<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Art History Eighteen to Twenty-First Century Art: Portable</h2><p>ART HISTORY provides students with the most student-friendly, contextual, and inclusive art history survey text on the market. These hallmarks make ART HISTORY the choice for instructors who seek to actively engage their students in the study of art. This new edition of ART HISTORY is the result of a happy and productive collaboration between two scholar-teachers (Marilyn Stokstad and Michael Cothren) who share a common vision that survey courses on the history of art should be filled with as much enjoyment as erudition, and that they should foster an enthusiastic, as well as an educated, public for the visual arts. Like its predecessors, this new edition seeks to balance formal and iconographic analysis with contextual art history in order to craft interpretations that will engage a diverse student population.

Preston, author of First Light ( LJ 12/87), provides more than a compelling account of the mill's creation; he profiles and champions Nucor's hard-working, fast-driving, heavy-drinking, union-hating, hot-metal steelworkers who literally risk their lives to rekindle the fire of America's steel industry. Using suspenseful, tension-filled narration and nontechnical language, Preston dramatizes the Crawfordsville Project's birthpangs and its revolutionary German steelmaking process that, after two years and $250 million, finally transforms rusted Cadillacs, abandoned refrigerators, and broken truck axles into hot-rolled steel. This book, which will find a wide audience, just might ignite a desire among businesses to resurrect other neglected industries as well. Highly recommended for all libraries. Excerpted in The New York er .<br><i>- Andrea C. Dragon, Coll. of St. Elizabeth, Convent Station, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In 1987 a maverick and minor-rank steel company named Nucor set out to challenge American "big steel" and foreign competition by crash-building on Indiana farmland a new facility, of German design, to produce sheet metal for consumer products, profitably and at competitive prices. In order to document this partial reversal of America's steel-industry decline, Preston ( First Light ) lived for months with Nucor's principal players: down-to-earth CEO Ken Iverson, larger-than-life project boss Keith Busse, cool unit manager Mark Millet and bossy Westphalian inventor-machinists. Also present are dozens of proud "hot metal" workers sweating around the clock to iron out start-up kinks, surviving fiery explosions and runaway meltdowns, and occasionally belting down boilermaker highballs to ease the tension. Preston's skillful narrative, deft characterization, authentic dialogue and description of operations make this an absorbing, informative, moving reading experience.

LORAC was a pen name of Edith Caroline Rivett (1894-1958) who was a prolific writer of crime fiction from the 1930s to the 1950s, and a member of the prestigious Detection Club. Her books have been almost entirely neglected since her death, but deserve rediscovery as fine examples of classic British crime fiction in its golden age."Lorac's descriptions of scenery, her quick summations of people's characters, and twisty plotting are all outstanding. Lorac also delivers a gasp-worthy "least likely suspect" ending." - <strong><em> Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>Glencoe Literature: Reading With Purpose, Course 3 (GLENCOE LITERATURE GRADE 7)</h2><p>Glencoe Literature: Reading with Purpose is the first research-based middle school language arts program that effectively combines strong skill development and incredible reading.

His words set Christendom afire. Some 100,000 men, from knights to paupers, took up the call--the largest mobilization of manpower since the fall of the Roman Empire.<br> Now, in <em>The First Crusade</em>, Thomas Asbridge offers a gripping account of a titanic three-year adventure filled with miraculous victories, greedy princes and barbarity on a vast scale. Readers follow the crusaders from their mobilization in Europe (where great waves of anti-Semitism resulted in the deaths of thousands of Jews), to their arrival in Constantinople, an exotic, opulent city--ten times the size of any city in Europe--that bedazzled the Europeans. Featured in vivid detail are the siege of Nicaea and the pivotal battle for Antioch, the single most important military engagement of the entire expedition, where the crusaders, in desperate straits, routed a larger and better-equipped Muslim army. Through all this, the crusaders were driven on by intense religious devotion, convinced that their struggle would earn them the reward of eternal paradise in Heaven. But when a hardened core finally reached Jerusalem in 1099 they unleashed an unholy wave of brutality, slaughtering thousands of Muslims--men, women, and children--all in the name of Christianity.<br> The First Crusade marked a watershed in relations between Islam and the West, a conflict that set these two world religions on a course toward deep-seated animosity and enduring enmity. The chilling reverberations of this earth-shattering clash still echo in the world today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Asbridge</strong> is Lecturer in Early Medieval History at Queen Mary, University of London. An acknowledged expert on the history of the Crusades, he has traveled extensively in the Near East following the route of the First Crusade.<br><br>"This lively account of the Crusade looks set to replace Steven Runciman's classic 1951 account of the expedition as the best introduction to the subject....Asbridge's book gives exactly the sort of fast-flowing narrative the story demands. He writes clearly and vigorously, with a fine eye for telling detail. Having walked considerable parts of the itinerary the Crusade followed, he presents a vivid picture of the landscapes they passed through. He admires the crusaders' hardiness and extraordinary boldness without condoning cruelties they inflicted....Recommended to a general reader who wants an introduction to the Crusades."--Hugh Kennedy, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge combines fast-paced history writing, evocative prose and lucid research for a first-rate history of the First Crusade....Brilliantly re-creates the three-year history of the First Crusade, chronicling its difficulties and victories, not downplaying its brutality but emphasizing its genuinely religious impulse."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Balances persuasive analysis with a flair for conveying with dramtic power the crusaders' plight throughout the nine-month siege of Antioch....Stunning...should revitalize the study of this fascinating period in European history."--Christopher Silvester, <em>The Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"Rousing....Asbridge knows this territory well. In 1999, he even walked 350 miles of the crusaders' route."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge, in keeping with his aim to produce a popular history, writes with maximum vividness."--Joan Acocella, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Asbridge has produced a taut, clear and exciting narrative, which also manages to convey the best of modern Crusader scholarship....His pace is tremendous, and he has a remarkable feel of place. It certainly helps that, like so many Crusaders nine centuries ago, Asbridge has himself walked 350 miles from Antioch towards Jerusalem."--<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Although well researched, the book wears its scholarship lightly and reads like a work of fiction, complete with vivid characters."--<em>The Herald</em> (Glasgow)<p></p><br>"Asbridge achieves vivid characterization and gripping storytelling without sacrifice of scholarship. Interweaving analysis, narrative, evocative description and occasional wry humor, he tells us--as no other book on the subject really does--who the crusaders were, how they behaved, how they killed and died and, most surprisingly of all, how they survived and triumphed."--Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, author of <em>Millennium</em> and <em>Civilizations</em><p></p><br>"There is an underlying assumption among commentators looking at the confrontation between Islam and the West that it has been engendered by the events of September 11, 2001. Thomas Asbridge, by tracing the roots to the First Crusade in his lucid and provocative 'new history,' helps us to understand the present by explaining the past."--Akbar S. Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies American University<p></p><br></p><h2>Th�r�se</h2><p>Dorothy Day's unpretentious account of the life of St. Th�r�se of Lisieux sheds light on the depth of Day's Catholic spirituality and illustrates why Th�r�se's simplicity and humility are so vital for today. Whether you are called to the active life like Day or a more hidden existence like Th�r�se, you will discover that these paths have much in common and can lead you to a love that has the power to transform you in ways that are unexpected and consequential.<br><br>Now back in print, this short biography of St. Th�r�se of Lisieux by Dorothy Day expresses the surprising yet profound connection between Day--the founder of the Catholic Worker movement who was praised by Pope Francis for her passion for justice and dedication to her faith--and the beloved saint best known for her Little Way.<br><br>When Day first read St. Th�r�se's autobiography, <i>The Story of a Soul</i> in 1928, she called it "pious pap." At the time, Day--a social activist who had been living a bohemian lifestyle--had only recently been baptized a Catholic. Some twenty-five years later, Day's perspective on Th�r�se had so completely changed that she was inspired to write this biography. She did not find it an easy task: "Every time I sit down to write that book on the Little Flower I am blocked. . . . I am faced with the humiliating fact that I can write only about myself, a damning fact." But she persisted, and despite numerous rejections eventually found a publisher for it in 1960. She wrote in the Preface: "In these days of fear and trembling of what man has wrought on earth in destructiveness and hate, Th�r�se is the saint we need."<br><br>Written originally for nonbelievers or those unaware of Th�r�se, the book reflects how Day came to appreciate Th�r�se's Little Way, not as an abstract concept, but as a spirituality that she had already been living. The Catholic Worker, which she cofounded with Peter Maurin, was dedicated to feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless. Day's life, like Th�r�se's, was filled with all the humble, self-effacing jobs that were a part of this work. She found in Th�r�se a kindred spirit, one who saw these simple hidden tasks as the way to heaven. "We want to grow in love but do not know how. Love is a science, a knowledge, and we lack it," Day wrote.<br><br>Just as Day had a conversion of heart about the Little Way, you, too, can be changed by Th�r�se's simple, yet profound spirituality.</p><p><b>Servant of God Dorothy Day (1897-1980)</b> was a pacifist, social commentator, journalist, convert to Catholicism, and cofounder of the Catholic Worker movement. She was the author of several books, including her autobiography, <i>The Long Loneliness</i>.<br><br><b>Robert Ellsberg</b> is the editor-in-chief and publisher of Orbis Books. He previously served as managing editor of <i>The Catholic Worker</i>."Dorothy Day's mature assimilation of Th�r�se of Lisieux's spirituality is a vital legacy for the Catholic Worker Movement and for anyone whose life is dedicated to working for peace and justice." --<b>James Allaire</b>, <i>The Catholic Worker</i><br><br>"Dorothy Day may not be remembered as one of Th�r�se's greatest biographers, but in Day, Th�r�se may well have found her most adept and significant student. On both a personal and a social level, she embraced the implications of Th�r�se's most famous words, 'All is grace.'" --From the foreword by <b>Robert Ellsberg</b>, Editor-in-chief of Orbis Books and former managing editor of <i>The Catholic Worker</i><br><br>"I feel honored to be able to pay this small bit of homage to a book by a saint of our day, Dorothy Day, whose love made her challenge the lie of what she always called 'this filthy rotten system,' and enabled her to see deeply enough into another saint of our day to recognize a kindred spirit, though her life, on the surface, seemed so different from Dorothy's own." --From the afterword by <b>John C. Cavadini</b>, Theology professor and director of the Institute for Church Life, University of Notre Dame</p><h2>The Time Machine</h2><p><p> Wells was interested in the implications of evolutionary theory on the future of human beings at the biological, sociological, and cultural levels, and <em>The Time Machine</em>, short and readable, draws on many of the social and scientific debates of the time. The Broadview edition of this science fiction classic includes extensive materials on Wells&#x2019;s scientific and political influences. </p></p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, lesser-known literature. Newly type-set and produced on high-quality paper in trade paperback format, the Broadview Literary Texts series is a delight to handle as well as to read. <p>Each volume includes a full introduction, chronology, bibliography, and explanatory notes along with a variety of documents from the period, giving readers a rich sense of the world from which the work emerged.</p>When the Time Traveller courageously stepped out of his machine for the first time, he found himself in the year 802,700--and everything has changed. In another, more utopian age, creatures seemed to dwell together in perfect harmony. The Time Traveller thought he could study these marvelous beings--unearth their secret and then retum to his own time--until he discovered that his invention, his only avenue of escape, had been stolen. H.G. Well&#39;s famous novel of one man&#39;s astonishing journey beyond the conventional limits of the imagination first appeared in 1895. It won him immediate recognition, and has been regarded ever since as one of the great masterpieces in the literature of science fiction.</p><h2>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Collections, Grade 10</h2><p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Collections: Student Edition Grade 10 c2015</p><p></p><h2>All Who Go Do Not Return: A Memoir</h2><p><b>Named one of "forty-two books to read before you die" by the&nbsp;<i>Independent</i>&nbsp;(UK)<br>2015 National Jewish Book Award Winner&nbsp;<br>2016 Winner of the GLCA New Writers Award in Nonfiction<br>One of Star Magazine's "Fab 5 Can't-Miss Entertainment Picks"</b><br><br><b>A moving and revealing exploration of Hasidic life, and one man's struggles with faith, family, and community</b><br><br>Shulem Deen was raised to believe that questions are dangerous.

His marriage at eighteen is arranged and several children soon follow. Deen's first transgression--turning on the radio--is small, but his curiosity leads him to the library, and later the Internet. Soon he begins a feverish inquiry into the tenets of his religious beliefs, until, several years later, his faith unravels entirely. <br><br>Now a heretic, he fears being discovered and ostracized from the only world he knows. His relationship with his family at stake, he is forced into a life of deception, and begins a long struggle to hold on to those he loves most: his five children.

Deen's memoir, however, does grant me that access. It is the book's ticket to mass appeal as well as the seat of his disquiet in its writing.Though he writes because he has a story to tell, Deen's work, especially in his memoir, is clearly crafted to benefit others dealing with a wavering faith.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tablet Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Shulem Deen has a fascinating story to tell, and he tells it with exquisite sensitivity. <i>All Who Go Do Not Return</i> gives us not only an insider's glimpse into a shrouded world few outsiders get to see, but also a movingly told narrative of one man's struggle toward intellectual integrity.

Among the Skver Hasids, all who go do not return, but in writing this memoir, Deen has returned, and brought us, his lucky readers, with him.

It is&nbsp;&nbsp;important that folk poetry be included because it is&nbsp;&nbsp;the root and inspiration of later, literary&nbsp;&nbsp;poetry. Not only does this book present the full range&nbsp;&nbsp;of Black poetry, but it presents most poets in&nbsp;&nbsp;depths, and in some cases presents aspects of a poet&nbsp;&nbsp;neglected or overlooked before. Gwendolyn Brooks&nbsp;&nbsp;is represented not only by poems on racial and&nbsp;&nbsp;domestic themes, but is revealed as a writer of&nbsp;&nbsp;superb love lyrics. Tuming away from White models and&nbsp;&nbsp;retuming to their roots has freed Black poets to&nbsp;&nbsp;create a new poetry.

Written by a well-known artist and expert instructor, <i>The Art of Still Life</i> offers a comprehensive, contemporary approach to the subject that instructs artists on the foundation basics and advanced techniques they need for successful drawing and painting. In addition to Casey's stunning paintings, the work of over fifty past and present masters is included, so that the book will do double duty as a hardworking how-to manual and a visual treasure trove of some of the finest still life art throughout history and being created today.</p><p><b>Todd M. Casey</b> was born and raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. His artistic education includes a BFA in Communication Design from Massachusetts College of Art in Boston. After receiving his degree in 2001, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a graphic designer. He then moved to San Francisco to pursue a Master's in Animation at the Academy of Art. While taking the foundation classes for his MFA, he found a true passion in painting, and returned to New York City to the studio of Jacob Collins at the Water Street Atelier and began his classical painting training in 2007. In 2010, he finished his studies and began teaching at the Guild Atelier in Brooklyn, New York. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Casey's work touches on more than simplistic, rigid realism. There is a haunting, nearly literary quality to each frame. A feeling that subjects are viewed from behind rain-kissed, mottled glass, burnished by enigmatic candlelight, or brushed by the soft, hazy edges of a half-remembered dream. His works are classically styled, but progressive in approach--fine, somber details, rendered with a clear, meticulous eye, and yet, subdued with a gentle, melancholic focus. Casey is the receipient of several awards. Most recently, he won first place two years in a row in the Portrait Society of America Members Only Competition, and first place in oil painting from the Allied Artists of America, in 2015. His work can be found in collections throughout the United States, and exclusively on the East Coast at Rehs Contemporary Gallery, in Midtown New York City. <br>Casey lives in New York with his wife, Gina, and baby daughter, Scarlet.</p><h2>Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt</h2><p><p><strong>Now a National Bestseller.</strong></p><p><strong>To get ahead today, you have to be a jerk, right?</strong></p><p>Divisive politicians.

For many of us, that sounds strange. We can t even imagine what the Black past was like before the slave trade, much less imagine that such a history goes back 200,000 years or more. Can you imagine what that does to a person? To grow up believing their people started out as slaves? Perhaps some of us know a little about Africa, but how much do we really know? How much do we know about the extent of the ancient Black empires that spanned far beyond continental Africa? Chances are, very little. In this book, we ll tell the stories you haven t been told. We ll talk about the Black migrations that settled the world. We ll show you the Black people who founded the first cultures and civilizations of Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia, the Pacific Islands, and North and South America. No exaggeration. This book covers more than 200,000 years of Black history across every square inch of the Planet Earth. As we learn the history of our ancestors, we ll learn more and more about ourselves.</p><p></p><h2>Montessori: The Science behind the Genius</h2><p>Traditional American schooling is in constant crisis because it is based on two poor models for children's learning: the school as a factory and the child as a blank slate. School reforms repeatedly fail by not learning from the shortcomings of these models.<br><br> One hundred years ago, Maria Montessori, the first female physician in Italy, devised a very different method of educating children, based on her observations of how they naturally learn. Does Montessori education provide a viable alternative to traditional schooling? Do Dr. Montessori's theories and practices stand up to the scrutiny of modern-day developmental psychology? Can developmental psychology tell us anything about how and why Montessori methods work?<br><br> In <em>Montessori</em>, now with a foreword by Renilde Montessori, the youngest grandchild of Maria Montessori, Angeline Stoll Lillard shows that science has finally caught up with Maria Montessori. Lillard presents the research concerning eight insights that are foundations of Montessori education, describing how each of these insights is applied in the Montessori classroom. In reading this book, parents and teachers alike will develop a clear understanding of what happens in a Montessori classroom and, more important, why it happens and why it works. Lillard, however, does much more than explain the scientific basis for Montessori's system: Amid the clamor for evidence-based education, she presents the studies that show how children learn best, makes clear why many traditional practices come up short, and describes an ingenious alternative that works. Everyone interested in education, at all levels and in all forms, will take from this book a wealth of insights. <em>Montessori</em> is indispensable reading for anyone interested in what psychologists know about human learning and development, and how to use it to improve teaching effectiveness.</p><p><br><strong>Angeline Stoll Lillard</strong> received her doctorate in psychology from Stanford University in 1991. She was awarded the Developmental Psychology Division of the American Psychological Association's Outstanding Dissertation Award in 1992 and its Boyd McCandless Award for Distinguished Early Career Contribution in 1999. A Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, Lillard is currently Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lives with her husband, two daughters, and four horses.<br><br>"If you want to understand Montessori education in light of current developmental research, you should seize upon this authoritative, interesting book. I highly recommend it for parents, educators, students of education--anyone, in fact, who would like a close-up look at the real needs of the developing child." --Jane M. Healy, Ph.D., Educational Psychologist; author of <em>Your Child's Growing Mind: Brain Development and Learning from Birth to Adolescence</em><p></p><br>"Inspired educational thinkers such as Dewey or Vygotsky only sketched out ways that we might teach young children. Over more than 50 years, Maria Montessori successfully created a radically new teaching system - a system that endures and inspires to this day. Angeline Lillard shows how many of Montessori's practices anticipated some of the latest and best findings in developmental psychology while still others call out for future empirical analysis. Lillard's comprehensive and fascinating assessment gives Montessori the place that she deserves in contemporary debate about how we should best teach children." --Paul L. Harris, Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education<p></p><br>"Lillard has masterfully explored the basic tenets of Montessori education and how they are validated with today's scientific findings. The result is a long-awaited and important contribution that contrasts with traditional education and offers evidence in support of a method that works. A stunning achievement!" --Virginia McHugh Goodwin, Executive Director, Association Montessori Internationale, USA<p></p><br>"This is a really excellent book. The author is unusually well qualified to write it. Angeline Lillard is an internationally renowned researcher in the area of cognitive-developmental psychology, who also has extensive experience and deep knowledge regarding Montessori. The book is not only authoritative and scholarly, it is also very well organized and very clearly written, easily communicable to anyone with an interest in the area. I enjoyed reading it."--John Flavell, Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor, Emeritus, School of Humanities and Sciences, Stanford University<p></p><br>"This is a great book. It is beautifully written, and expertly uses the psychological research literature to evaluate Montessori theory and practice. What an original and important contribution." --Carol Dweck, Professor of Psychology, Stanford University<p></p><br>"...a stimulating evaluation of Montessori philosophy and practice, exploring some of the basic principles in relation to modern scientific research...an interesting resource that encourages teachers (from all methods) to reflect on their educational practices. In particular, anyone wanting to take a detailed and critical look at Montessori education would surely benefit from reading this book."--<em>Montessori International</em><p></p><br>"I was impressed by this book, enjoyed reading it, and learned a lot about Montessori's method...Lillard's book has convinced me to pay a visit to our local Montessori school and to seriously consider it as an option for my own child."--R. Keith Sawyer, <em>PsycCRITIQUES</em><p></p><br>"Angeline Lillard may have changed the rules of engagement for debates on educational reform. " --Dennis Schapiro, Editor, <em>The Public Montessorian</em><p></p><br>"This book makes a wonderful case for the genius and enduring contributions of Montessori education and its visionary founder. It can informreaders search to understand Montessori education today." --<em>Applied Developmental Psychology</em><p></p><br>"Angeline Lillard's compelling review of research literature reminds us that Dr. Maria Montessori was a scientist, that Montessori pedagogy is based in empirical fact, and that modern educational research is echoing the developmental principles fundamental to Montessori education. Parents, teachers, and educational researchers are reading this book because it is simply the most sophisticated Montessori commentary of our time." --David Kahn, Executive Director, North American Montessori Teachers' Association<p></p><br>"Dr. Angeline Stoll Lillard has clearly summarized the research that explains why, after 100 years, the Montessori approach to education continues to be a phenomenal worldwide success." --Tim Seldin, President, The Montessori Foundation, and Chair, The International Montessori Council<p></p><br>"Lillard provides a visionary framework for those currently working to advance Montessori education and those committed to furthering school reform initiatives. This is an illuminating, thoughtful, and extremely important book." --Richard A.

The result is a tale that has taken on the force of myth in the popular imagination. This Broadview edition provides a fascinating selection of contextual material, including contemporary reviews of the novel, Stevenson&#39;s essay &#34;A Chapter on Dreams,&#34; and excerpts from the 1887 stage version of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Also included are historical documents on criminality and degeneracy, the &#34;Jack the Ripper&#34; murders, and London in the 1880s. New to this second edition are an updated critical introduction and, in the appendices, writings on Victorian psychology by Thomas Carlyle, Richard Krafft-Ebing, and Henry Maudsley, among others.</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Grant, and the followers of Julius Evola and Aleister Crowley <br><br>� Provides instructions on how to identify egregores, free yourself from parasitic and destructive entities, and destroy an egregore, should the need arise <br><br>One of most important but little known concepts of Western occultism is that of the egregore, an autonomous psychic entity created by a collective group mind. An egregore is sustained by belief, ritual, and sacrifice and relies upon the devotion of a group of people, from a small coven to an entire nation, for its existence. An egregore that receives enough sustenance can take on a life of its own, becoming an independent deity with powers its believers can use to further their own spiritual advancement and material desires. <br><br>Presenting the first book devoted to the study of egregores, Mark Stavish examines the history of egregores from ancient times to present day, with detailed and documented examples, and explores how they are created, sustained, directed, and destroyed. He explains how egregores were well known in the classical period of ancient Greece and Rome, when they were consciously called into being to watch over city states. He explores the egregore concept as it was understood in various Western Mystery traditions, including the Corpus Hermeticum, and offers further examples from Tibetan Buddhism, Islam, modern esoteric orders such as the Order of the Golden Dawn and Rosicrucianism, the writings of H. P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Grant, and the followers of Julius Evola and Aleister Crowley. The author discusses how, even as the fundamental principles of the egregore were forgotten, egregores continue to be formed, sometimes by accident. <br><br>Stavish provides instructions on how to identify egregores, free yourself from a parasitic and destructive collective entity, and destroy an egregore, should the need arise. Revealing how egregores form the foundation of nearly all human interactions, the author shows how egregores have moved into popular culture and media--underscoring the importance of intense selectivity in the information we accept and the ways we perceive the world and our place in it.</p><p>Mark Stavish is a respected authority on Western spiritual traditions. The author of 26 books, published in 7 languages, including <i>The Path of Alchemy</i> and <i>Kabbalah for Health and Wellness</i>, he is the founder and director of the Institute for Hermetic Studies and the Louis Claude de St. Martin Fund. He has appeared on radio shows, television, and in major print media, including <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, the History Channel, BBC, and the <i>New York Times</i>. The author of the blog VOXHERMES, he lives in Wyoming, Pennsylvania.<b>Chapter 5</b> <br>The Lovecraft Circle <br>Robert E. Howard and Conan the Barbarian <br><br>Robert Ervin Howard (1906-1936) wrote over a hundred stories for publication in a career that lasted twelve years. He is widely accepted as the father of the &#x201c;sword and sorcery genre&#x201d; with his creation of &#x201c;Conan the Barbarian.&#x201d; <br><br>In August 1930, Howard wrote a letter to <i>Weird Tales</i> magazine that would begin an active correspondence with H. P. Lovecraft. This exchange of letters, opinions, and literary ideas would initiate Howard into &#x201c;The Lovecraft Circle,&#x201d; where he was introduced to many authors of similar interests; each member of the group encouraged others to contribute to the various fictional worlds and mythologies they had created. This unique feature of the circle elevated it beyond what is often thought of as &#x201c;networking&#x201d; in modern business terms, or a writers' club, but into a magical operation wherein the thought forms it generated took on vigorous lives of their own--as can be seen by the longevity of the works created by its members almost three-quarters of a century after it was started. <br><br>In April 1932, Howard wrote to Lovecraft and detailed his most recent heroic character--King Conan the Cimmerian, also known as &#x201c;Conan the Barbarian.&#x201d; Howard later stated, &#x201c;Conan simply grew up in my mind a few years ago when I was stopping in a little border town on the Rio Grande. I did not create him by any conscious process. He simply stalked full grown out of oblivion and set me at work recording the saga of his adventures.&#x201d; He would later state to fellow &#x201c;Lovecraft Circle&#x201d; member Clark Ashton Smith, While I do not go so far as to believe that stories are inspired by actually existent spirits or powers (though I am rather opposed to flatly deny anything), I have sometimes wondered if it were possible that unrecognized forces from the past or present--or even the future--work through the thoughts and actions of living men. This occurred to me when I was writing the first stories of the Conan series especially. I know that for months I had been unable to work up anything sellable. Then the man Conan seemed suddenly to grow up in my mind without much labor on my part and immediately a stream of stories flowed off my pen--or rather, my typewriter--almost without effort on my part. I did not seem to be creating, but rather relating events that had occurred. Episode crowded episode so fast that I could scarcely keep up with them. For weeks I did nothing but write of the adventures of Conan. The character took complete possession of my mind and crowded out everything else in the way of story-telling.&#x201d; (1)<br><br><b>Arthur Machen and &#x201c;The Bowman&#x201d;</b> <br><br>One of the writers read by Howard and other members of The Lovecraft Circle was Arthur Machen. Machen&#x2019;s greatest literary achievements were in the gothic horror genre. However, it is his often ignored involvement in a widely reported &#x201c;paranormal event&#x201d; that is of interest to shapers of mass consciousness and public perception. <br><br>In August 1914, the British Expeditionary Force was in retreat. The war--which was supposed to end in a few weeks--was going badly for Allied forces in France and morale was plummeting. Machen recalled reading the newspapers of the day describing the retreat of British forces, and stated that he fell into despair. Machen, who was then working as a journalist writing war reports and various propaganda pieces from the home front, wrote a piece entitled &#x201c;The Bowman,&#x201d; first published on September 29, 1914, in the <i>London Evening News</i>. The piece was a work of fiction, but this apparently was not clearly stated, as the story presented soon took on a life of its own. The story reports of ghostly apparitions appearing at a critical moment to protect the retreating British soldiers, with phantasmal arrows slaying advancing Germans by the thousands. <br><br>Desire for such divine (or at least supernatural) intervention was so strong amidst a population hearing of their army in retreat that it went from being not just the ghosts of English longbowmen--as Machen had originally written--but to angels under the direction of St.George, the patron saint of Great Britain. Churches and other religious bodies took up the story to inspire, comfort, and encourage their congregations, whose fathers and sons were fighting in France for reasons that were not always very clear. Soon, stories appeared of enlisted men and officers who claimed to have seen something miraculous on the day in question--but these were all after the fact, and none were ever substantiated. Machen would later write a letter of regret stating that it "was as if I had touched the button and set in action a terrific, complicated mechanism of rumours that pretended to be sworn truth, of gossip that posed as evidence, of wild tarradiddles that good men most firmly believed.&#x201d;(2)<br><br>Over time, this event went from being divine intervention to wishful thinking, coupled with collective hallucination induced by the stress of battle. Yet the desire for supernatural intervention in our world, particularly that of St. George--the patron saint of the British egregore, if you will--was not enough. Many in the occult community saw it as a magical act, either intentional or unintentional by Machen, using the collective energies of the mass mind. Here, Machen was not simply raising the spirits of his readers during a time of despair; he was in fact raising real spirits, an army of them to do battle with very real corporeal enemies. While there appears to be no truth in this, the effect was nonetheless the same: a collective thought form had been created, it was attached to an egregore (St. George), and strengthened through repetition and religious rites.</p><h2>A Sea of Words: A Lexicon and Companion for Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s Seafaring Tales</h2><p>A companion reference for fans of the popular historical fiction series includes more than two thousand cross-referenced terms, diagrams, maps, and accompanying short essays.

These influential essays, interviews, and critical and theoretical comments provide bold and fertile insights into the construction of visual knowledge. Featuring a wide range of leading and emerging artists since 1945, the collection&#x2014;while comprehensive and authoritative&#x2014;offers the reader some eclectic surprises as well.<br><br>Included here are texts that have become pivotal documents in contemporary art, along with writings that cover unfamiliar ground. Some are newly translated, others have never before been published. Together they address visual literacy, cultural studies, and the theoretical debates regarding modernism and postmodernism. The full panoply of visual media is represented, from painting and sculpture to environments, installations, performance, conceptual art, video, photography, and virtual reality. Thematic concerns range from figuration and process to popular culture, art and technology, and politics and the media. Contemporary issues of gender, race, class, and sexuality are also addressed.<br><br>Kristine Stiles's general introduction is a succinct overview of artists' theories in the evolution of contemporary discourse around art. Introductions to each chapter provide synopses of the cultural contexts in which the texts originated and brief biographies of individual artists. The text is augmented by outstanding photographs, many of artists in their studios, and vivid, contemporary art images.<br><br>Reflecting the editors' shared belief that artists' own theories provide unparalleled access to visual knowledge, this book, like its distinguished predecessors, Hershel Chipp's <i>Theories of Modern Art</i> (with Peter Selz and Joshua Taylor) and Joshua Taylor's <i>Nineteenth-Century Theories of Art</i>, will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in contemporary art.<br><br>"In New York in 1915 I bought at a hardware store a snow shovel on which I wrote 'in advance of the broken arm.' It was around that time that the word 'readymade' came to mind to designate this form of manifestation."&#x2014;Marcel Duchamp (1961)<br><br>"Women have always collected things and saved and recycled them because leftovers yielded nourishment in new forms. The decorative functional objects women made often spoke in a secret language, bore a covert imagery. When we read these images in needlework, in paintings, in quilts, rugs and scrapbooks, we sometimes find a cry for help, sometimes an allusion to a secret political alignment, sometimes a moving symbol about the relationships between men and women."&#x2014;Miriam Schapiro and Melissa Meyer (1978)<br><br>"I want to create a fusion of art and life, Asia and America, Duchampiana modernism and Levi-Straussian savagism, cool form and hot video, dealing with all of those complex problems, spanning the tribal memory of the Nomadic Asians who crossed over the Bering Strait over 10,000 years ago."&#x2014;Shigeko Kubota (1976)<br><br>"Black for me is a lot more peaceful and gentle than white. White marble may be very beautiful, but you can't read anything on it. I wanted something that would be soft on the eyes, and turn into a mirror if you polished it. The point is to see yourself reflected in the names. Also the mirror image doubles and triples the space."&#x2014;Maya Lin (1983)<br><br>"Artists often depend on the manipulation of symbols to present ideas and associations not always apparent in such symbols. If all such ideas and associations were evident there would be little need for artists to give expression to them. In short, there would be no need to make art."&#x2014;Andres Serrano (1989)</p><p>"The accomplishment of this book is astounding. This book will change the way scholars think about the totality of the world of contemporary art, and it will be the essential text for generations of students to come."&#x2014;Richard Shiff, University of Texas, Austin<br><br>"An indispensable resource: compendious, diverse, and in some of its unfamiliar juxtapositions, startlingly fresh."&#x2014;Lisa Tickner, Middlesex University, London<br><br>"Contrary to the popular myth of the "inarticulate" artist, the literature of contemporary art is rich and varied and, until now, widely scattered. This is the most comprehensive selection of such writings available. An essential resource for scholars, it also offers the lay reader generous doses of vivid and provocative writing."&#x2014;Robert Storr, Museum of Modern Art, New York<br><br>"<i>Theories and Documents</i> not only fills an important gap in the field of modern and contemporary art but is also a major contribution in its own right. It rejects narrowly stylistic or medium-defined categories and instead organizes the artists' texts in relation to broader cultural, social, and technological concerns. It deepens and complicates our knowledge of the art of our time."&#x2014;Abigail Solomon-Godeau, University of California, Santa Barbara<br><br>"A very useful anthology that performs two crucial functions: it brings artists of different generations and nationalities into conversation, and it comprehends art in its new mediums, practices, and problems."&#x2014;Hal Foster, Editor, <i>October</i><br><br>"Professors Stiles and Selz have presented us with a textbook that is as indispensable as it is authoritative. It will surely be seen as the standard reference for those seeking primary sources in the complex field of contemporary art studies."&#x2014;David Ross, Whitney Museum of Art, New York&#34;The accomplishment of this book is astounding. This book will change the way scholars think about the totality of the world of contemporary art, and it will be the essential text for generations of students to come.&#34; (Richard Shiff, University of Texas, Austin)</p><h2>Mary Engelbreit Cross-Stitch</h2><p>Here it is, for the first time - an entire book that lovingly converts the artwork of Mary Engelbreit to cross-stitch patterns.

The text includes a review of American history up to the Civil War.</p></p><p></p><h2>Black Boy</h2><p><p><strong>Richard Wright's&nbsp;powerful and eloquent memoir of his journey from innocence to experience in the Jim Crow South&#x2014;at</strong><strong> once an unashamed confession and a profound indictment, <em>Black Boy</em> is a poignant and disturbing record of social injustice and human suffering. </strong><strong>This 75th anniversary edition will have a beautiful new cover and will include a new introduction.</strong><strong></strong></p><p>When <em>Black Boy</em> exploded onto the literary scene in 1945, it caused a sensation. Orville Prescott of the <em>New York Times</em> wrote that &#x201c;if enough such books are written, if enough millions of people read them maybe, someday, in the fullness of time, there will be a greater understanding and a more true democracy.&#x201d; Opposing forces felt compelled to comment: addressing Congress, Senator Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi argued that the purpose of this book &#x201c;was to plant seeds of hate and devilment in the minds of every American.&#x201d; From 1975 to 1978, <em>Black Boy</em> was banned in schools throughout the United States for &#x201c;obscenity&#x201d; and &#x201c;instigating hatred between the races.&#x201d;</p><p>The once controversial, now classic American autobiography&nbsp;measures the brutality and rawness of the Jim Crow South against the sheer desperate will it took to survive. Richard Wright grew up in the woods of Mississippi, with poverty, hunger, fear, and hatred. He lied, stole, and raged at those about him; at six he was a &#x201c;drunkard,&#x201d; hanging about in taverns. Surly, brutal, cold, suspicious, and self-pitying, he was surrounded on one side by whites who were either indifferent to him, pitying, or cruel, and on the other by blacks who resented anyone trying to rise above the common lot. The second half of the book focuses on Wright&#x2019;s move north to Chicago, and his experiences with the Communist Party (a section that was pulled from the book&#x2019;s original publication).</p><p><em>Black Boy</em>&nbsp;is Richard Wright's compelling account of his journey. Deeply affecting and beautifully written, it is as timely today as when it was first published seventy-five years ago. </p></p><p>Richard Wright won international renown for his powerful and visceral depiction of the black experience. He stands today alongside such African-American luminaries as Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison, and two of his novels, <em>Native Son </em>and<em> Black Boy,</em> are required reading in high schools and colleges across the nation. He died in 1960.&#x201c;Superb....A great American writer speaks with his own voice about matters that still resonate at the center of our lives.&#x201d; (Alfred Kazin, New York Times Book Review on Black Boy)</p><h2>Ballet Basics</h2><p>Written for the adult beginner, <i>Ballet Basics</i> is a well-illustrated introduction to the fundamentals of ballet technique.

Nevertheless, it&#x2019;s frequently back-burnered.

And it&#x2019;s surprisingly simple: frequent short conversations with employees about their career goals and options integrated seamlessly into the normal course of business.

Helping them grow. It&#x2019;s like eating properly or exercising. <br>You know it&#x2019;s good. You know you should. Yet, if you&#x2019;re like many managers today, you just don&#x2019;t do it as well or as frequently as you would like. <br>In survey after survey, year after year, employees express their dissatisfaction with how they are being supported in their careers. At the same time, managers across industries, regions, and levels uniformly report a moderate to severe lack of competence, comfort, and confidence in themselves in regards to this critical job expectation. <br>What IF &#x2026; <br>you could more easily and frequently engage in the career development work that employees crave without sacrificing everything else that must get done? <br>employees learned to assume greater responsibility for their careers? <br>it was possible for career development to be integrated into the work that needs to get done as opposed to being a separate series of overwhelming tasks that have to be checked off a list? <br>You could. They can. And it can be. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve written this book. <br>HELP THEM GROW <br>Career development is as important as it&#x2019;s ever been (maybe more). In today&#x2019;s business environment, talent is the major differentiator. And developing that talent is one of the most significant drivers of employee engagement, which in turn is the key to the business outcomes you seek: revenue, profitability, innovation, productivity, customer loyalty, quality, and cycle time reduction. <br>But the reality of career development is changing in response to the new business landscape. It&#x2019;s not the wide-open playing field it once was. Boomers are waiting longer to retire. Repeated rounds of belt tightening have led to delayering and downsizing. More jobs are outsourced. All of this breeds a sense of scarcity and leaves the impression that there aren&#x2019;t as many opportunities as there once were. This makes career development more&#x2014;not less&#x2014;important than in the past. <br>OR WATCH THEM GO <br>Ignore the development imperative at your own peril. Every day, employees who believe that their careers are not getting the attention they deserve make the decision to leave. Some resign to pursue employment in organizations that offer greater opportunity. Others decide the freelance life fits them better, and they cobble together a variety of projects that become a career. <br>But an equally dangerous situation occurs when employees stay but withdraw their engagement, motivation, and enthusiasm for the work. <br>CAREER CONVERSATIONS EMPLOYEES WANT <br>So, what&#x2019;s a manager to do? Plenty. And it might be easier than you expect. Quality career development boils down to quality conversations. <br>Throughout this book, we&#x2019;ll challenge you to reframe career development in such a way that responsibility rests squarely with the employee, and that your role is more about prompting, guiding, reflecting, exploring ideas, activating enthusiasm, and driving action. This role centers around talking about&#x2014;rather than actually doing the heavy lifting of&#x2014;development. <br>We&#x2019;ll offer a framework for thinking about conversations that help others grow. It involves three distinct types of conversations: hindsight, foresight, and insight. <br>Hindsight conversations are those that help others look backward and inward to determine who they are, where they&#x2019;ve been, what they love, and where they excel. Chapters 3 and 4 provide you with questions and ideas for helping others look back as a basis for moving forward. <br>Foresight conversations are designed to keep employees looking forward and outward toward changes, trends, and the ever-evolving big picture. Chapter 5 offers easy, straightforward tools that are long on value and short on your time investment. <br>Chapters 6, 7, and 8 focus on leveraging the insights that surface from the convergence of hindsight and foresight. How do the employees&#x2019; strengths fit into where the organization or industry is going? Where are there opportunities to carve out space to grow and perform? Out of the work that needs to be done, which activities will give people unique experiences and fodder for development? <br>In Chapter 9, you&#x2019;ll learn how to grow with the flow or embed development into everyday life through heightened awareness and fluid conversation strategies. <br>HOW TO READ THIS BOOK <br>You&#x2019;re probably doing a pretty good job so far. Here are just a few thoughts to get the most from the experience. <br>This book was written for anyone who has a role in developing others. The titles vary from organization to organization: Supervisor, Manager, Director, Team Leader, Vice President, CEO. We&#x2019;ve chosen to use the term manager generically. Whenever you see it, it means you. <br>This book is all about the career conversations employees want. So we&#x2019;ll draw heavily upon employees&#x2019; voices. These are real individuals in the workplace whose eloquent insights make the point far better than we could. They aren&#x2019;t the entitled whiners with unrealistic expectations. They&#x2019;re your solid citizens. The ones you count on to produce. The ones you&#x2019;re hoping will stick around. <br>TRY THIS <br>You&#x2019;ll find lots of questions and activities you can use with your employees. We&#x2019;ll call them out like this. Have an upcoming career conversation? Scan the pages for an exercise, tuck the book under your arm, and you&#x2019;re ready to go. <br>WHAT ABOUT YOU? <br>So, you&#x2019;re somebody&#x2019;s employee too, right? And, if you&#x2019;re like many managers, you get caught in the middle, doing the right thing for your employees, but not necessarily having it done for you. As you read this book, you may find yourself thinking, this sounds pretty good, but what about me? Answer: do it yourself! <br>The tools and questions throughout this book are highly flexible. Change you to i and you&#x2019;re ready for some self-discovery. You might find it helpful to review the answers with someone at work or at home. A fresh set of eyes may pick up clues and offer a different perspective and new insights. <br>We&#x2019;ll close each chapter with some what ifs. We know that as a manager responsible for delivering business results, you must keep your feet planted firmly on the ground. So, from that grounded position, take a moment to consider what just might be possible. <br>What IF &#x2026; <br>you kept reading and tried out even one or two ideas with your employees? <br>They would grow.</p><h2>Wars and Capital (Semiotext(e) / Foreign Agents)</h2><p><p><b>A critique of capital through the lens of war, and a critique of war through the lens of the revolution of 1968.</b></p><p>&#x201c;We are at war,&#x201d; declared the President of the French Republic on the evening of November 13, 2015. But what is this war, exactly?</p><p>In <i>Wars and Capital</i>, �ric Alliez and Maurizio Lazzarato propose a counter-history of capitalism to recover the reality of the wars that are inflicted on us and denied to us. We experience not the ideal war of philosophers, but wars of class, race, sex, and gender; wars of civilization and the environment; wars of subjectivity that are raging within populations and that constitute the secret motor of liberal governmentality. By naming the enemy (refugees, migrants, Muslims), the new fascisms establish their hegemony on the processes of political subjectivation by reducing them to racist, sexist, and xenophobic slogans, fanning the flames of war among the poor and maintaining the total war philosophy of neoliberalism.</p><p>Because war and fascism are the repressed elements of post-'68 thought, Alliez and Lazzarato not only read the history of capital through war but also read war itself through the strange revolution of '68, which made possible the passage from war in the singular to a plurality of wars&#x2015;and from wars to the construction of new war machines against contemporary financialization. It is a question of pushing &#x201c;'68 thought&#x201d; beyond its own limits and redirecting it towards a new pragmatics of struggle linked to the continuous war of capital. It is especially important for us to prepare ourselves for the battles we will have to fight if we do not want to be always defeated.</p></p><p>�ric Alliez is a philosopher and Professor at Universit� Paris 8 and at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London. He is author of <i>Capital Times</i>, <i>The Signature of the World: Or, What is Deleuze and Guattari's Philosophy?</i>, <i>The Brain-Eye: New Histories of Modern Painting</i>, and <i>Wars and Capital</i>, with Maurizio Lazzarato (Semiotext(e)), and coeditor of <i>The Guattari Effect</i>, and <i>Spheres of Action: Art and Politics</i> (MIT Press).</p><h2>Music: An Appreciation</h2><p>Through seven editions, Roger Kamien&#39;s Music: An Appreciation has become the most widely used text for Music Appreciation and Introduction to Music Literature courses.

He gets it. I've read a hundred how-to-make-it-in-the-music-biz books, and this one is today's definitive, comprehensive manual." &#x2015;Jack Conte, 150+ million YouTube views, Pomplamoose, CEO of Patreon</strong></p><p>Forget everything you think you know about the odds of &#x201c;making it&#x201d; in the music industry. Today, odds mean nothing and success is not about lucky breaks. It&#x2019;s about conquering social media, mastering the art of merchandising and simply working harder and being smarter than everyone else. We are living in the midst of an industry renaissance, one that has left the record companies desperately struggling to maintain their prominence, as a subculture of dedicated, DIY (do-it-yourself) musicians have taken over. These days talent is a given and success has to be earned.</p><p>In 2008, Ari Herstand boldly turned in his green Starbucks apron to his manager, determined to make a living off his craft as a singer/songwriter. Almost a decade later, he has become a founding member of the new DIY movement and a self-sustaining musician, all without the help of a major label. Now, drawing from years of experience, Herstand has written the definitive guide for other like-minded artists, the ones who want to forge their own path and not follow the traditional markers of success, like record sales, hits on the radio or the amount of your label advance. Incredibly comprehensive and brutally honest throughout, <em>How to Make It in the New Music Business</em> covers every facet of the "new" business, including how to:</p><ul><li>Build a grass-roots fan base&#x2015;and understand the modern fan</li><li>Book a profitable tour, and tips for playing live, such as opening vs. headlining etiquette, and putting on a memorable show</li><li>Become popular on YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud</li><li>Get songs placed in film and television</li><li>Earn royalties you didn&#x2019;t know existed and reach your crowdfunding goals</li></ul><p>Musicians will not only be introduced to all the tools available today but will be shown how to effectively leverage them to actually make money. More important, they will develop the mindset to be aware of new advancements both online and in the real world and always stay in tune with a constantly evolving landscape.</p><p>There has never been a better time to be an independent musician. Today, fans can communicate with their idols by simply picking up their phones, artists are able to produce studio-worthy content from their basement and albums are funded not by "record men" but by generous, engaged supporters. As result, <em>How to Make It in the New Music Business</em> is a must-have guide for anyone hoping to navigate the increasingly complex yet advantageous landscape that is the modern music industry.</p></p><p><strong>Ari Herstand</strong> is a DIY musician who has played over seven hundred shows around the country, has performed on <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>, has charted in the top 10 on iTunes and has had his music featured in countless TV shows, commercials and films. He currently fronts the funk band Brassroots District. In 2012, Herstand launched the music business advice blog <em>Ari&#x2019;s Take</em> (www.aristake.com), which was nominated by <em>L.A.

In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Learning to Love: Exploring Solitude and Freedom- The Journal of Thomas Merton, Vol. 6</h2><p>Depicts the author&#39;s struggle with love and his recommittment to the monastic life through a greater understanding of both worldly and spiritual love</p><p><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) is widely regarded as one of the most influential spiritual writers of modern times. He was a Trappist monk, writer, and peace and civil rights activist.

The tale seems to begin with buried treasure and then turns into an unprecedented historical detective story - a modern Grail quest leading back through cryptically coded parchments, secret societies, the Knights Templar, the Cathar heretics of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and a dynasty of obscure French kings deposed more than 1,300 years ago. The author's conclusions are persuasive: at the core is not material riches but a secret - a secret of explosive and controversial proportions, which radiates out from the little Pyrenees village all the way to contemporary politics and the entire edifice of the Christian faith. It involves nothing less than... the Holy Grail.</p></p><p>MICHAEL BAIGENT graduated from Christchurch University, New Zealand.

Alarmingly, the greatest income gap is not between the 1 percent and the 99 percent, but within the wealthiest 1 percent of our nation--as the merely wealthy are left behind by the rapidly expanding fortunes of the new global super-rich. Forget the 1 percent; <i>Plutocrats</i> proves that it is the wealthiest 0.1 percent who are outpacing the rest of us at break-neck speed.<br><br>What&#x2019;s changed is more than numbers. Today, most colossal fortunes are new, not inherited--amassed by perceptive businessmen who see themselves as deserving victors in a cut-throat international competition. As a transglobal class of successful professionals, today&#x2019;s self-made oligarchs often feel they have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home. Bringing together the economics and psychology of these new super-rich, <i>Plutocrats </i>puts us inside a league very much of its own, with its own rules.<br><br>The closest mirror to our own time is the late nineteenth century Gilded Age--the era of powerful &#x2018;robber barons&#x2019; like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Then as now, emerging markets and innovative technologies collided to produce unprecedented wealth for more people than ever in human history. Yet those at the very top benefited far more than others--and from this pinnacle they exercised immense and unchecked power in their countries. Today&#x2019;s closest analogue to these robber barons can be found in the turbulent economies of India, Brazil, and China, all home to ferocious market competition and political turmoil. But wealth, corruption, and populism are no longer constrained by national borders, so this new Gilded Age is already transforming the economics of the West as well. <i>Plutocrats</i> demonstrates how&nbsp; social upheavals generated by the first Gilded Age may pale in comparison to what is in store for us, as the wealth of the entire globalized world is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.<br><br>Cracking open the tight-knit world of the new global super-rich is Chrystia Freeland, an acclaimed business journalist who has spent nearly two decades reporting on the new transglobal elite. She parses an internal Citigroup memo that urges clients to design portfolios around the international &#x201c;Plutonomy&#x201d; and not the national &#x201c;rest&#x201d;; follows Russian, Mexican, and Indian oligarchs during the privatization boom as they manipulate the levers of power to commandeer their local economies; breaks down the gender divide between the vast female-managed &#x2018;middle class&#x2019; and the world&#x2019;s one thousand billionaires; shows how, by controlling both the economic and political institutions of their nation, the richest members of China&#x2019;s National People&#x2019;s Congress have amassed more wealth than every branch of American government combined--the president, his cabinet, the justices of the Supreme Court, and both houses of Congress.<br><br>Though the results can be shocking, Freeland dissects the lives of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest individuals with empathy, intelligence, and deep insight. Brightly written, powerfully researched, and propelled by fascinating original interviews with the plutocrats themselves, <i>Plutocrats </i>is a tour-de-force of social and economic history, and the definitive examination of inequality in our time.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>CHRYSTIA&nbsp;FREELAND is the Editor of Thomson Reuters Digital, following years of service at the <i>Financial Times</i> both in New York and London.

What were the luxuries have become the necessaries of life. The laborer has now more comforts than the farmer had a few generations ago. The farmer has more luxuries than the landlord had, and is more richly clad and better housed. The landlord has books and pictures rarer and appointments more artistic than the king could then obtain.<br>&#x2014;Andrew Carnegie</p><p>Branko Milanovic is an economist at the World Bank. He first became interested in income inequality studying for his PhD in the 1980s in his native Yugoslavia, where he discovered it was officially viewed as a &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; subject&#x2014;which meant one the ruling regime didn&#x2019;t want its scholars to look at too closely. That wasn&#x2019;t a huge surprise; after all, the central ideological promise of socialism was to deliver a classless society.</p><p>But when Milanovic moved to Washington, he discovered a curious thing. Americans were happy to celebrate their super-rich and, at least sometimes, worry about their poor. But putting those two conversations together and talking about economic inequality was pretty much taboo.</p><p>&#x201c;I was once told by the head of a prestigious think tank in Washington, D.C., that the think tank&#x2019;s board was very unlikely to fund any work that had income or wealth inequality in its title,&#x201d; Milanovic, who wears a beard and has a receding hairline and teddy bear build, explained in a recent book. &#x201c;Yes, they would finance anything to do with poverty alleviation, but inequality was an altogether different matter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Because &#x2018;my&#x2019; concern with the poverty of some people actually projects me in a very nice, warm glow: I am ready to use my money to help them. Charity is a good thing; a lot of egos are boosted by it and many ethical points earned even when only tiny amounts are given to the poor. But inequality is different: Every mention of it raises in fact the issue of the appropriateness or legitimacy of my income.&#x201d;</p><p>The point isn&#x2019;t that the super-elite are reluctant to display their wealth&#x2014;that is, after all, at least part of the purpose of yachts, couture, vast homes, and high-profile big-buck philanthropy. But when the discussion shifts from celebratory to analytical, the super-elite get nervous. One Wall Street Democrat, who has held big jobs in Washington and at some of America&#x2019;s top financial institutions, told me President Barack Obama had alienated the business community by speaking about &#x201c;the rich.&#x201d; It would be best not to refer to income differences at all, the banker said, but if the president couldn&#x2019;t avoid singling out the country&#x2019;s top earners, he should call them &#x201c;affluent.&#x201d; Naming them as &#x201c;rich,&#x201d; he told me, sounded divisive&#x2014;something the rich don&#x2019;t want to be. Striking a similar tone, Bill Clinton, in his 2011 book, <i>Back to Work</i>, faulted Barack Obama for how he talks about those at the top. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t attack them for their success,&#x201d; President Clinton wrote, attributing to that softer touch his greater success in getting those at the top to accept higher taxes.</p><p>Robert Kenny, a Boston psychologist who specializes in counseling the super-elite, agrees. He told an interviewer that &#x201c;often the word &#x2018;rich&#x2019; becomes a pejorative. It rhymes with &#x2018;bitch.&#x2019; I&#x2019;ve been in rooms and seen people stand up and say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Bob Kenny and I&#x2019;m rich.&#x2019; And then they burst into tears.&#x201d;</p><p>It is not just the super-rich who don&#x2019;t like to talk about rising income inequality. It can be an ideologically uncomfortable conversation for many of the rest of us, too. That&#x2019;s because even&#x2014;or perhaps particularly&#x2014;in the view of its most ardent supporters, global capitalism wasn&#x2019;t supposed to work quite this way.</p><p>Until the past few decades, the received wisdom among economists was that income inequality would be fairly low in the preindustrial era&#x2014;overall wealth and productivity were fairly small, so there wasn&#x2019;t that much for an elite to capture&#x2014;then spike during industrialization, as the industrialists and industrial workers outstripped farmers (think of China today). Finally, in fully industrialized or postindustrial societies, income inequality would again decrease as education became more widespread and the state played a bigger, more redistributive role.</p><p>This view of the relationship between economic development and income inequality was first and most clearly articulated by Simon Kuznets, a Belarusian-born immigrant to the United States. Kuznets illustrated his theory with one of the most famous graphs in economics&#x2014;the Kuznets curve, an upside-down U that traces the movement of society as its economy becomes more sophisticated and productive, from low inequality, to high inequality, and back down to low inequality.</p><p>Writing in the early years of the industrial revolution, and without the benefit of Kuznets&#x2019;s data and statistical analysis, Alexis de Tocqueville came up with a similar prediction: &#x201c;If one looks closely at what has happened to the world since the beginning of society, it is easy to see that equality is prevalent only at the historical poles of civilization. Savages are equal because they are equally weak and ignorant. Very civilized men can all become equal because they all have at their disposal similar means of attaining comfort and happiness. Between these two extremes is found inequality of condition, wealth, knowledge&#x2014;the power of the few, the poverty, ignorance, and weakness of the rest.&#x201d;</p><p>If you believe in capitalism&#x2014;and nowadays pretty much the whole world does&#x2014;the Kuznets curve was a wonderful theory. Economic progress might be brutal and bumpy and create losers along the way. But once we reached that Tocquevillian plateau of all being &#x201c;very civilized men&#x201d; (yes, men!), we would all share in the gains. Until the late 1970s, the United States, the world&#x2019;s poster child of capitalism, was also an embodiment of the Kuznets curve. The great postwar expansion was also the period of what economists have dubbed the Great Compression, when inequality shrank and most Americans came to think of themselves as middle class. This was the era when, in the words of Harvard economist Larry Katz, &#x201c;Americans grew together.&#x201d; That seemed to be the natural shape of industrial capitalism.</p><p>Even the Reagan Revolution rode on the coattails of this paradigm&#x2014;trickle-down economics, after all, emphasizes the trickle. But in the late 1970s, things started to change. The income of the middle class started to stagnate and those at the top began to pull away from everyone else. This shift was most pronounced in the United States, but by the twenty-first century, surging income inequality had become a worldwide phenomenon, visible in most of the developed Western economies as well as in the rising emerging markets.</p><p>The switch from the America of the Great Compression to the America of the 1 percent is still so recent that our intuitive beliefs about how capitalism works haven&#x2019;t caught up with the reality. In fact, surging income inequality is such a strong violation of our expectations that most of us don&#x2019;t realize it is happening.</p><p>That is what Duke University behavioral economist Dan Ariely discovered in a 2011 experiment with Michael Norton of Harvard Business School. Ariely showed people the wealth distribution in the United States, where the top 20 percent own 84 percent of the total wealth, and in Sweden, where the share of the top 20 percent is just 36 percent. Ninety-two percent of respondents said they preferred the wealth distribution of Sweden to that of the United States today. Ariely then asked his subjects to give their ideal distribution of wealth for the United States. Respondents preferred that the top 20 percent own just 32 percent of total wealth, an even more equitable distribution than Sweden&#x2019;s. When it comes to wealth inequality, Americans would prefer to live in Sweden&#x2014;or in the late 1950s compared to the United States today. And they would like kibbutz-style egalitarianism best of all.</p><p>But the gap between the data and our intuition is not a good reason to ignore what is going on. And to understand how American capitalism&#x2014;and capitalism around the world&#x2014;is changing, you have to look at what is happening at the very top. That focus isn&#x2019;t class war; it&#x2019;s arithmetic. Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and former secretary of the Treasury, is hardly a radical. Yet he points out that America&#x2019;s economic growth over the past decade has been so unevenly shared that, for the middle class, &#x201c;for the first time since the Great Depression, focusing on redistribution makes more sense than focusing on growth.&#x201d;</p><p>The skew toward the very top is so pronounced that you can&#x2019;t understand overall economic growth figures without taking it into account. As in a school whose improved test scores are due largely to the stellar performance of a few students, the surging fortunes at the very top can mask stagnation lower down the income distribution. Consider America&#x2019;s economic recovery in 2009&#x2013;2010. Overall incomes in that period grew by 2.3 percent&#x2014;tepid growth, to be sure, but a lot stronger than you might have guessed from the general gloom of that period.</p><p>Look more closely at the data, though, as economist Emmanuel Saez did, and it turns out that average Americans were right to doubt the economic comeback. That&#x2019;s because for 99 percent of Americans, incomes increased by a mere 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the incomes of the top 1 percent jumped by 11.6 percent. It was definitely a recovery&#x2014;for the 1 percent.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a similar story behind the boom in the emerging markets. The &#x201c;India Shining&#x201d; of the urban middle class has left untouched hundreds of millions of peasants living at subsistence levels, as the Bharatiya Janata Party discovered to its dismay when it sought reelection on the strength of that slogan; likewise, China&#x2019;s booming coastal elite is a world apart from the roughly half of the population who still live in villages in the country&#x2019;s vast hinterland.</p><p>This book is, therefore, an attempt to understand the changing shape of the world economy by looking at those at the very top: who they are, how they made their money, how they think, and how they relate to the rest of us. This isn&#x2019;t "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous", but it also isn&#x2019;t a remake of <i>Who Is to Blame?</i>, the influential nineteenth-century novel by Alexander Herzen, the father of Russian socialism.</p><p>This book takes as its starting point the conviction that we need capitalists, because we need capitalism&#x2014;it being, like democracy, the best system we&#x2019;ve figured out so far. But it also argues that outcomes matter, too, and that the pulling away of the plutocrats from everyone else is both an important consequence of the way that capitalism is working today and a new reality that will shape the future.</p><p>Other accounts of the top 1 percent have tended to focus either on politics or on economics. The choice can have ideological implications. If you are a fan of the plutocrats, you tend to prefer economic arguments, because that makes their rise seem inevitable, or at least inevitable in a market economy. Critics of the plutocrats often lean toward political explanations, because those show the dominance of the 1 percent to be the work of the fallible Beltway, rather than of Adam Smith.</p><p>This book is about both economics and politics. Political decisions helped to create the super-elite in the first place, and as the economic might of the super-elite class grows, so does its political muscle. The feedback loop between money, politics, and ideas is both cause and consequence of the rise of the super-elite. But economic forces matter, too. Globalization and the technology revolution&#x2014;and the worldwide economic growth they are creating&#x2014;are fundamental drivers of the rise of the plutocrats. Even rent-seeking plutocrats&#x2014;those who owe their fortunes chiefly to favorable government decisions&#x2014;have also been enriched partly by this growing global economic pie.</p><p>America still dominates the world economy, and Americans still dominate the super-elite. But this book also tries to put U.S. plutocrats into a global context. The rise of the 1 percent is a global phenomenon, and in a globalized world economy, the plutocrats are the most international of all, both in how they live their lives and in how they earn their fortunes.</p><p>Henry George, the nineteenth-century American economist and politician, was an ardent free trader and such a firm believer in free enterprise that he opposed income tax. For him, the emergence of his era&#x2019;s plutocrats, the robber barons, was &#x201c;the Great Sphinx.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This association of poverty with progress,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;is the great enigma of our times. . . . So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress brings goes but to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and make sharper the contrast between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is not real and cannot be permanent.&#x201d;</p><p>A century and a half later, that Great Sphinx has returned. This book is an attempt to unravel part of that enigma by opening the door to the House of Have and studying its residents.</p></p><h2>El principe Caspian: Prince Caspian (Spanish edition) (Las cronicas de Narnia, 4)</h2><p>Narnia... where the animals talk... where the trees walk.

Portland, Or.</p><p>In southern California, nearly a half century ago, a small band of researchers -- equipped with a new 200-inch telescope and a faith born of scientific optimism -- embarked on the greatest intellectual adventure in the history of humankind: the search for the origin and fate of the universe. Their quest would eventually engulf all of physics and astronomy, leading not only to the discovery of quasars, black holes, and shadow matter but also to fame, controversy, and Nobel Prizes. Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos tells the story of the men and women who have taken eternity on their shoulders and stormed nature in search of answers to the deepest questions we know to ask.&#34;Dennis Overbye, who studied physics at MIT, is also the author of Einstein in Love.

Carter was a restless man, seemingly in a constant state of motion. On one of his travels across the sparsely settled mountains and valleys that surrounded his home in southern Virginia, he met and married a young girl named Sara Dougherty. Orphaned as a child, Sara was remote by nature but seemed to find release in singing the typically melancholy ballads that were a part of her home tradition. </p><p> For fun, A.P., Sara, and her cousin Maybelle (who married A.P.'s brother "Eck" Carter) would play and sing the hymns and ballads known in their Poor Valley community, occasionally adding songs A.P. had collected during his travels. Then, in 1927, they traveled to Bristol, Tennessee, to audition for a New York record executive who was hunting "hillbilly" talent and offering an amazing fifty dollars per song for any he recorded. These Bristol recording sessions would become generally accepted as the "Big Bang" of country music, producing two of its first stars: Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family. </p><p> By the early 1930s, the Carter Family was the most bankable country music group in America, with total sales of more than a million records. By the late '30s, they were appearing regularly on high-power radio station XERA, which broadcast from coast to coast. A whole generation of country people could gather around the radio and hear the sound of music that came straight from their world. Johnny Cash in Arkansas, Waylon Jennings in Texas, Chet Atkins in Georgia, and Tom T. Hall in Kentucky all listened to the Carter Family. It was their formal schooling, Country Music 101. </p><p> Inside the Carter Family, however, things were hardly perfect. Though nobody outside the family knew it, Sara had left her difficult and quixotic husband in 1933. In 1936 she won a divorce. Even throughout the long and painful breakup, the Carters kept performing together, singing an ever-widening range of new songs they wrote or old songs they remade: songs of love, of betrayal, and of the death of fondest hopes. And they kept at it even after Sara married A.P.'s cousin Coy Bays in 1939. After fulfilling a final radio contract in 1943, Sara and Coy moved to California to settle near his family. The original Carter Family never performed or recorded together again. </p><p> With Sara gone, A.P. retreated home, opened a general store, and lived out the next two decades in obscurity, the odd man out in a new and reconfigured Carter musical clan. Meanwhile, Maybelle and her daughters (Helen, June, and Anita) went out and got themselves new radio contracts, working in Richmond, Virginia; Knoxville, Tennessee; and Springfield, Missouri, before ascending to country music's ultimate stage, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. Nearly fifty years in the business won Maybelle the title "Mother of Country Music" and the adoration of generations of guitar players and just plain listeners. </p><p> The story of the Carter Family is a bittersweet saga of love and fulfillment, sadness and loss. <i>Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone?</i> is more than just a biography of a family; it is also a journey into another time, almost another world. But their story resonates today and lives on in the timeless music they created.</p></p><p><b>Mark Zwonitzer</b> is a writer-director whose work appears nationally on public television. He is currently finishing up work on a documentary about the creation of the transcontinental railroad and hopes to begin work soon on a documentary about the Carter Family. He lives in Connecticut.<p><b>Chapter One: Pleasant</b> </p><p> Five separate mountain ridges cut on a southwest diagonal through Scott County, Virginia: Powell's and Stone westernmost, out by the Kentucky border; Clinch Mountain farthest south and east, not far from the Tennessee border; and in between, the Copper Creek and Moccasin ridges. Every big valley rolls and folds into itself, forming valleys within valleys, haunts and hollows that can't be seen from even the highest perch in the county, on top of Clinch Mountain, 3,200 feet up. So you'd have to have a pretty fair knowledge of the richly filigreed landscape, of the right roadless gap to take, to make your way into the deepest hollows. That inaccessibility, with its promise of well-hid treasures, has always been the heart of the romance of the Appalachian Mountains. "A mysterious realm," the writer Horace Kephart called the southern Appalachians, <i>"terra incognita."</i> Kephart was a St. Louis librarian who had traveled widely in Europe and spent years cataloging a gargantuan collection of works by and about a fourteenth-century Italian poet. In 1904, with his penchant for the obscure surprisingly undiminished, Kephart moved to the America's southern mountains and began cataloging the culture of its natives. </p><p> Ten years later he brought out his book <i>Our Southern Highlanders</i> and introduced a people as exotic to his fellow academics as South Sea islanders or Eskimos. For a decade Kephart had plumbed the region's language, superstitions, work patterns, diet, and dentistry: "It was here I first heard of 'tooth-jumping,'" wrote Kephart. "Let one of my old neighbors tell it in his own words: 'You take a cut nail (not one o' those round wire nails) and place its squar p'int agin the ridge of the tooth, jest under the edge of the gum. Then jump the tooth out with a hammer. A man who knows how can jump a tooth without it hurtin' half as bad as pullin'. But old Uncle Neddy Cyarter went to jump one of his own teeth out, one time, and missed the nail and mashed his nose with the hammer....Some men git to be as experienced at it as tooth-dentists are at pullin'. They cut around the gum, and then put the nail at jest sich an angle, slantin' downward for an upper tooth or upwards for a lower one, and hit one lick.' </p><p> "'Will the tooth come at the first lick?' </p><p> "'Ginerally. If it didn't you might as well stick your head in a swarm o' bees and ferget who you are.'" </p><p> It's no wonder Horace got caught up in the flat-out <i>oddness</i> of the remotest hollows (the "back of beyond," he called it), but his seminal work in the mountains had the effect of obscuring the regal and practical <i>breadth</i> of Appalachian culture. By 1913, it was way too late for <i>rural</i> to still be thought of as synonymous with <i>backward</i> or <i>isolated.</i> At the time Kephart was doing his fieldwork, a young native of Scott County, Leonidas Reuben Dingus, educated at the free schools near Wood, Virginia, was presenting his own postdoctoral papers, to wit: "Study of Literary Tendencies in the Novellen of Theodore Storm," "A Brief on Schiller's Esthetic Philosophy," and "<i>Beowulf</i> Translated into Alliterative Verse -- Selections." It was with evident pride that Dingus was celebrated as "one of the ripest scholars the county has produced." </p><p> A full generation before Kephart arrived, Scott County had ninety-six public schools and two local newspapers, not counting the <i>Toledo Blade,</i> which arrived over the mountains by horseback in Copper Creek every two weeks. There was nobody who wasn't but a few hours' ride from a railroad station, and from there you could get to Kingsport, Nashville, Indianapolis, Washington, D.C., or New York. And the railroads could deliver any of the largest or most exotic items to be found in the Montgomery Ward or Sears, Roebuck catalogs. Usually that wasn't necessary, however, for most of what was needed could be got right in Scott County. There were forty corn and flour mills, fourteen sawmills, and two woolen mills, all powered by the creeks and rivers that ran through the valleys. Every wide place in the road, such as Fido, Osborn's Ford, and Nickelsville, had a general merchandise store that stocked everything from fine china to Cracker Jacks. Even the outlying areas were dotted with home manufacturers who could take a body from cradle to grave. You could buy a pram, a wagon, or a coffin, handmade locally. </p><p> In Hiltons, James P. Curtis was doing a fine trade in both guns and butter. He'd invented a churn that ran by the motion of a rocking chair, and a more efficient turn plow for the hundreds of dirt farmers scratching a living off of the land. But he is remembered best for his rifles. During the Civil War, Curtis had supplied nearly a thousand Kentucky rifles to the Confederate army. At the turn of the century, his long-shot rifles were still in wide use in the land disputes that had entered the American consciousness as "feuds." </p><p> More than anything else in Scott County, land counted. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, nearly four-fifths of Scott County's seventeen thousand residents farmed. Even at $2.26 an acre, no commodity was more precious than land. And it wasn't just the present value of the land that mattered, but the future value. In fact, the fastest growing trades in the county -- as in most of Appalachia -- were land agentry and lawyering. And most of the men practicing these professions were under the employ of the railroads and their subsidiaries, out on the prowl, quietly leasing mineral or timber rights from local farmers. "Inexhaustible beds of iron ore (red and brown hematite) are found in this county," boasted a local business directory in 1889, "and manganese, lead, coal, marble of various kinds, and limestone in abundance....The extension of the Narrow-Gauge road through this county from Bristol in Tennessee, will open up its mineral treasures, which now lie buried awaiting convenient and cheap transportation facilities." </p><p> Already, in 1891, the railroads and their affiliates were clear-cutting tens of thousands of acres of forest for crossties and square-set mining timbers. Five separate mines were in full cry, blasting coal and iron out of the ground, filling up freight cars behind the gleaming new Norfolk &amp; Western or Virginia &amp; Southwestern engines, all headed for the more populated and higher-paying parts of America. The railroads were not a paternal force in the valleys, not by a long shot. Neither were the timber companies or the mine owners or the quarry operators. They meant to dig out of the land whatever value it held, and Scott Countians take the hindmost. By 1891, for better or worse, the future had rumbled into the valleys. </p><p> <br> From her little one-room log cabin on the other side of Pine Ridge, Mollie Bays Carter couldn't hear the Virginia &amp; Southwestern engines roll through Poor Valley. Not that she didn't have her ears open to them. It was the middle of the night and she was by the fire, still in her day clothes, sitting bolt upright on a cane-backed chair. On her lap she held a shotgun. </p><p> Mollie was just nineteen and she still held her beauty, which owed in no small part to the Cherokee in her. Her great-grandfather was a half-blood, and you could see it in Mollie's high cheekbones, her dark eyes, and her straight coal-black hair. She kept her hair long ("A woman's hair is her glory," they taught her at the Friendly Grove Methodist Church). When she let it down, it would fall well below her narrow waist. But Mollie rarely let her hair down. She plaited it every day and kept it tied in a fat bun on top of her tiny head. Above all, Mollie was a Christian woman and modest in her appearance. </p><p> In the cabin that night, she was alone except for her infant son, Alvin Pleasant Delaney Carter, who was born just weeks before, on December 15, 1891. That's why she was up in the middle of the night. Earlier that day, Mollie had spied a panther skulking around the farm. There was no glass in the windows of her cabin; she'd just hung sackcloth over them. That might keep out the wind, but it wasn't going to keep out a hungry panther. So Mollie sat alert and awake all night long, in frightened defense of her newborn son. </p><p> Where her husband, Bob, was she couldn't have said for sure. Robert Carter was part of a long line of roaming mountain men, from Daniel Boone (who had been so constitutionally unsettled that he had, at age eighty, still searched out new trails) to the novelist Thomas Wolfe (who would occasionally, and without purpose, walk the entire circumference of Manhattan Island). Bob Carter was a far-wanderer, a gangly, long-legged man, and, truth be told, a bit flaky. He never was much for work, and there were times when Mollie would look up and Bob was just plain gone. No telling where...or for how long. </p><p> One thing he liked to do was visit the sick. Bob could sit bedside for hours, praying over the afflicted. If somebody in the Valley was dying of cancer, neighbors might help plant the corn or bring in the harvest, but most made a point to stay well outside the plagued house, reckoning any sickness could be catching. Not Robert Carter. Later, during the big influenza epidemic of 1917, he was so stalwart and so fearless that he would earn the nickname "Flu-proof Bob." Another thing Bob liked to do was inquire about local happenings. He was an enthusiastic gatherer of news; some said gossip. One neighbor lady who was a bit peeved by some of Bob's more personal reporting took to calling him by the local newspaper name. ("Well, here comes the <i>Scott Banner,</i>" she'd say, loud enough for him to hear as he approached. "He's got all the news.") But Bob never let the taunts slow him down. Comfort and news were Bob Carter's business, and that business kept him on the move. Later in the marriage, Mollie learned to read the signs. When Bob began chopping wood and stacking it high, she knew he was about to leave. The higher the stack, the longer he'd be gone. </p><p> "Bob, are you leaving your family again?" a neighbor once admonished. </p><p> "Well, if you can take any better care of them than I can," he shot back, "go on ahead." </p><p> "Uncle Bob would be walking by our homeplace and say, 'Well, where's your dad?'" his nephew Vernon Bays remembers. "He would ask a dozen questions: 'When did he leave?' 'When's he gonna be back?' 'What'd he go there for?' and he never stopped walking. Just walking and asking questions and bringing news." </p><p> Bob might be gone from home a day, or -- say, he went to visit his cousin Amanda Groves -- he might be gone a week. Mandy Groves was a striking woman, six feet tall and broad-shouldered, with flaming red hair she kept pulled back so it didn't fly into an unruly frizz. Mandy was nosy, too, and witchlike. She never forgot anything. She could give chapter and verse on what happened on a specific day forty years before. Neighbors who had no record of their birth date would go to see Mandy, and she'd know. <i>You were born July 6, thirty-eight years ago. That's the day they brought the wheat in over at Wolfe's.</i> Looked like a storm all day, but never did rain. Well, there was nothing Mandy didn't know, and Bob could put his feet under her table and get all the goings-on. Besides, over by Mandy there was always some land squabble. Her own husband, Abraham, once plugged Jerry McMurray with a bullet from the silver-plated rifle Old Man Curtis had made for him. So there was plenty of interest at Mandy's house. </p><p> In later years, when Bob was on the circuit, Mollie might be able to track him by telephone. There were only a few phones in Poor Valley, or over in Little Poor Valley, but somebody would have seen him, and they'd tell him to get on home, that Mollie said it was time to strip the tobacco. But way back in 1891, on that cold, dark night, Mollie Bays Carter had no way of knowing precisely where her new husband was. Maybe Bob had walked down the Little Valley to Hiltons, and then another half dozen miles along the Appalachian Trail to the county seat, where he could alert the sheriff of the "addition to the family" and record the birth of his new son, Alvin Pleasant Carter, in the Scott County registrar's books. Or maybe he was off to visit an uncle, see about work. It was hard to know. </p><p> From the beginning, Mollie Bays knew Bob Carter was going to be a project. She'd first seen him about 1888, not long after her family moved across Clinch Mountain and into Poor Valley so that they could be nearer the new railroad. She'd gone to a square dance, where she'd seen Bob playing the fiddle. And not only could he fiddle, but he could hit the back-step, too. He was more than six feet tall, fair-skinned, strong-jawed, and only a bit sunken in the chest. His hair was wavy and brown, shading to auburn. Whenever Mollie told the story of their meeting, she'd talk about watching him on the dance floor with his patent-leather lace-up boots with the blue bands around the tops and his "stri-ped britches." She always said he was the prettiest thing she'd ever seen and that she fell in love with him the minute she saw him. </p><p> But there were things about Robert Carter that could have given her pause. Bob had seen some of the world already, having just returned from a railroad job in Richmond, Indiana. And Mollie had pretty good reason to believe that Bob Carter had seen the business end of a whiskey bottle as well. ("Most Carters of that generation," says a family historian, "didn't hesitate to take a good sip of whiskey.") There was also the thorny question of his provenance. His Little Valley neighbors all said Bob was "base-born," a phrase, like many in the region, meant to muddy the actual meaning, a way of talking about things that kept outsiders in the dark. There were other such phrasings: If a man was "in his back," he was, in fact, drunk as a skunk; if in wartime he had gone "scoutin'," he was, in fact, hiding up on the mountain, dodging conscription. So the locals might have called him base-born, but to put it in the plain English of the day, Bob Carter was somebody's bastard son. </p><p> Bob's grandfather had been the first Carter to come over to the south side of Clinch Mountain. Dulaney Carter was the son of a well-off landowner from Rye Cove, twenty miles northwest of Poor Valley, and a descendant of one of the earliest and most esteemed settlers in Scott County. He had also married well. His bride, Rebecca Smith, was the daughter of John "Dutch" Smith, who'd got a land grant for exemplary service in the Revolutionary War. So when Dulaney arrived in Poor Valley in 1833, he was doubly staked, which was why when they spoke of him, his own children would say that Dulaney had managed to drink up <i>two</i> fortunes. "The bottle," says his great-grandson, "got the better of him. He had nothing when he died, and he left his children with nothing." </p><p> Dulaney's second child, Nancy Carter, had it particularly rough. She was a big-boned woman, with a streak of independence as wide as the Delaware and a weakness for pipe smoking and men. At twenty, she'd married a teenager named William Anderson Bays. They had four children together before he went off to fight for the Confederacy in the War Between the States. Billy Bays didn't return from the war for nearly a full year after Lee's surrender, ...</p></p><h2>Sakura Hime: The Legend of Princess Sakura, Vol. 4 (4)</h2><p>A new supernatural fantasy from the creator of The Gentleman's Alliance+!<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style). <br><br> Sakura is the granddaughter of a mysterious moon princess who slew demons with her Blood Cherry Blossom sword.

Mahler and her collaborators break new ground in developmental psychology and present the first complete theoretical statement of Dr. Mahler&#39;s observations on the normal separation-individuation process.Separation and individuation are presented in this major work as two complementary developments. Separation is described as the child&#39;s emergence from a symbiotic fusion with the mother, while individuation consists of those achievements marking the child&#39;s assumption of his own individual characteristics. Each of the subphases of separation-individuation is described in detail, supported by a wealth of clinical observations which trace the tasks confronting the infant and his mother as he progresses toward achieving his own individuality.A number of chapters are devoted to following five children epigenetically through their subphase development. A separate section describes the authors&#39; methodology, the importance of the research setting, and the effects of changes in the setting. The extensive appendices by Fred Pine discuss the uniqueness of the data-gathering techniques used by the authors.

Styled the �Black Flag� campaign, it was agreed to by Lincoln in a council with his generals in 1864. Cisco reveals the shelling and burning of cities, systematic destruction of entire districts, mass arrests, forced expulsions, wholesale plundering of personal property, and even murder of civilians.Carefully researched largely from primary sources, this examination also gives full attention to the suffering of Black victims of Federal brutality. </p></p><p><p>"Of all the enormities committed by Americans in the nineteenth century--including slavery and the Indian wars--the worst was the invasion of the South, which destroyed some twenty billion dollars of private and public property and resulted in the deaths of some two million people, most of whom were civilians--both white and black." <br>--David Aiken, editor of A City Laid Waste: The Capture, Sack, and Destruction of the City of Columbia</p><p>Finally, here is the first book-length survey of the Union's "hard war" against the people of the Confederacy--one that included the shelling and burning of cities, systematic destruction of entire districts, mass arrests, forced expulsions, wholesale plundering, and murder.</p><p>In a series of compelling chapters, Cisco chronicles the St. Louis massacre, where Federal authorities proceeded to impose a reign of terror and dictatorship in Missouri. He tells of the events leading to, and the suffering caused by, the Federal decree that forced twenty thousand Missouri civilians into exile. The arrests of civilians, the suppression of civil liberties, theft, and murder to "restore the union" in Tennessee are also examined.</p><p>Women and children were robbed, brutalized, and left homeless in Sherman's infamous raid through Georgia. In South Carolina, homes, farms, churches, and whole towns disappeared in flames. Civilians received no mercy at the hands of the Union invaders. </p><p>Thoroughly researched from sources including letters, diaries, and newspaper accounts of the time, Walter Brian Cisco's exhaustive book notably pays careful attention to the suffering of African-American victims of Federal brutality, revealing that wherever Federal troops encountered Southern blacks, whether free or slave, they were robbed, brutalized, belittled, kidnapped, threatened, tortured, and sometimes raped or killed by their blue-clad "liberators." </p><p>Apologists for Lincoln's hard war continue to downplay the suffering endured and the damage done, blame the victims, or call some of the above incidents "accidents" or "mistakes." Many also cling to the Lincolnian myth that only by the most horrendous of wars could the slaves be freed, ignoring the fact that the rest of the Western world managed to bring an end to the institution without bloodshed. This book serves to set the record straight and to show that the war on Southern civilians was not justified, despite the convictions by many that such a war was necessary to save the union. </p><p>Walter Brian Cisco's first book, States Rights Gist: A South Carolina General of the Civil War, a biography of the little-known general, was a 1992 selection of the History Book Club. He is also the author of Taking a Stand: Portraits from the Southern Secession Movement, Henry Timrod: A Biography, and Wade Hampton: Confederate Warrior, Conservative Statesman, considered the definitive biography of Hampton and the 2006 winner of the Douglas Southall Freeman History Award. He lives in Orangeburg, South Carolina. </p><p>"Despite the spinning of romantic historians, hard evidence indicates that the invasion of the South is the American enormity."<br>--David Aiken, editor of A City Laid Waste: The Capture, Sack, and Destruction of the City of Columbia</p><p>"Millions of Americans devoutly believe that Abraham Lincoln's war 'to preserve the union and free the slaves' was a righteous mission that forms the high point of our country's history. Mr. Cisco, concisely and without emotion, portrays the extent to which that war was waged with gratuitous brutality, persecution, terror, destruction, and murder against the civilian population of the South--free and slave, black and white, rich and poor. And he leaves no doubt that these war crimes were not incidental and accidental but were deliberate, pervasive, and sanctioned at the highest level with malice aforethought. Americans who read War Crimes Against Southern Civilians will have a more sober and true, and less self-righteous, understanding of our country."<br>--Clyde N. Wilson, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History, University of South Carolina</p><p>"At last the South is recovering sufficiently from intellectual imperialism for her real scholars and intellectuals to mount a countercharge. Academic history has for many years been written from the standpoint of the war's victors, both in the North and South, but that stranglehold is finally ending. Cisco's volume is yet another volley in that war for truth.

In his immensely readable and accessible style, Lencioni makes the case that there is no better way to achieve profound improvement in an organization than by attacking the root causes of dysfunction, politics and confusion. While too many leaders are still limiting their search for advantage to conventional and largely exhausted areas like marketing, strategy and technology. Lencioni demonstrates that there is an untapped gold mine sitting right beneath them. Instead of trying to become smarter, he asserts that leaders and organizations need to shift their focus to becoming healthier, allowing them to tap into the more-than-sufficient intelligence and expertise they already have.</p><p></p><h2>Wild Heart, a Life: Natalie Clifford Barney&#39;s Journey from Victorian America to the Literary Salons of Paris</h2><p><p>Charismatic, brilliant, and beautiful, the American writer Natalie Clifford Barney, who lived in Paris for most of her long life, is best known for three things: her Left Bank literary salon, often acknowledged as the most important of the twentieth century; her books of epigrams about life, love, and the nature of womanhood; and a liberated approach to sex that she refused to cloak, even in the midst of the Victorian era.</p><p>Born to great wealth in 1876 and raised in Washington, D.C., and Bar Harbor, Maine, Barney was expected to marry well and lead the conventional life of a privileged society woman. But Natalie wasn't interested in marriage and made no secret of the fact that she was attracted to women.</p><p>Raised by a nonconformist and artistic mother -- the painter Alice Pike Barney -- Natalie developed an early interest in poetry and the arts. Moving to Paris at the century's turn, she plunged into the city's vibrant social and literary scene, quickly becoming known among the young, cutting-edge literati as "the rarest and most intelligent woman" of her time. She was equally renowned as a notorious seductress, one who effortlessly conquered the hearts of women and the minds of men. The story of her first notorious love affair -- with Liane de Pougy, the most sought-out courtesan of Belle �poque Paris -- was transformed by Liane, with Natalie's assistance, into a bestselling 1901 roman � clef. Natalie's lovers continued to write about her for decades -- sometimes impishly (Colette), or with brutal honesty (Lucie Delarue-Mardrus), or with a disturbing mixture of anger, worship, and grief (the tragic poet Ren� Vivien). Men, including would-be lovers such as Remy de Gourmont or Bernard Bereson, tended to write of Barney with admiration, even reverence. Ultimately, her powerful salon and compelling personality attracted the greatest figures of twentieth-century arts and letters, including Edna St. Vincent Millay, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and Truman Capote.</p><p>A dazzling literary biography, <em>Wild Heart: A Life</em> is a story of a true rebel who came of age at a time when rebels weren't admired -- particularly if they were women -- and who has since become an icon to many others. Set against the backdrop of two different societies, Victorian America and Belle �poque Europe, <em>Wild Heart: A Life</em> beautifully captures the richness of their love.</p></p><p>Suzanne Rodriguez is the author of <em>Found Meals of the Lost Generation,</em> a social history of Americans in Paris in the 1920s. She lives in California.Born in 1876 to a wealthy American family from Ohio with connections to the arts her grandfather built the second opera house in New York City Barney began her public life at the age of six when she met Oscar Wilde. After coming out as a lesbian in the U.S. (at 17, she had her first love affair with 20-year-old Evalina Palmer), Barney moved to Paris in 1899 and began a very public affair with Lilane de Pougy, celebrated courtesan and author of romantic potboilers. By 1903, Barney boasted of having "the most respectable of bad reputations"; no less then three literary works (including a novel by Colette) featured thinly veiled portraits of her as a notorious lesbian. Notoriety begot legend as Barney, having formed deep friendships with Gide, Pierre Louys, Paul Claudel, Remy Gourmont and other literary stars, became one of the most famous salonists in Paris as well as a noted poet and novelist who published 21 books. By the time of her death in 1972, Barney was a literary and social institution. Rodriguez (Found Meals of the Lost Generation) has done a superb job assembling the historical details (she traces Barney's ancestry back to the mid-1700s) and in fleshing out Parisian literary history (such as Barney's intense rivalry with Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas). She deals with the romantic complications of Barney's life, especially a long affair with painter Romaine Brooks, with grace, and delineates the contradictions in Barney's life, such as espousing a glib anti-Semitism even as she was being harassed by the Nazis because of her Jewish heritage. This bio, the first of Barney in English in more than 20 years, should resurrect deserved interest in a major 20th-century literary player. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Truth about Melody Browne</h2><p>When she was nine years old, Melody Browne&#39;s house burned down, taking every toy, every photograph, every item of clothing and old Christmas card with it. But not only did the fire destroy all her possessions, it took with it all her memories - Melody Browne can remember nothing before her ninth birthday. Now in her early thirties, Melody lives in a council flat in the middle of London with her seventeen-year-old son. She hasn&#39;t seen her parents since she left home at fifteen, but Melody doesn&#39;t mind, she&#39;s better off on her own. She&#39;s made a good life for herself and her son and she likes it that way. Until one night something extraordinary happens. Whilst attending a hypnotist show with her first date in years she faints - and when she comes round she starts to remember. At first her memories mean nothing to her but then slowly, day by day, she begins to piece together the real story of her childhood. Her journey takes her to the seaside town of Broadstairs, to oddly familiar houses in London backstreets and to meetings with strangers who love her like their own. But with every mystery she solves another one materialises, with every question she answers another appears. And Melody begins to wonder if she&#39;ll ever know the truth about her past...</p><p>Lisa Jewell had always planned to write her first book when she was fifty. In fact she wrote it when she was twenty-seven and had just been made redundant from her job as a secretary.

Now Henry Petroski turns to the subject of books and bookshelves, and wonders whether it was inevitable that books would come to be arranged vertically as they are today on horizontal shelves. As we learn how the ancient scroll became the codex became the volume we are used to, we explore the ways in which the housing of books evolved. Petroski takes us into the pre-Gutenberg world, where books were so scarce they were chained to lecterns for security. He explains how the printing press not only changes the way books were made and shelved, but also increased their availability and transformed book readers into books owners and collectors. He shows us that for a time books were shelved with their spines <i>in</i>, and it was not until after the arrival of the modern bookcase that she spines faced <i>out</i>.<br><br>In delightful digressions, Petroski lets Seneca have his say on "the evils of book collecting"; examines the famed collection of Samuel Pepys (only three thousand titles: old discarded to make room for new); and discusses bookselling, book buying, and book collecting through the centuries.<br><br>Richly illustrated and wonderfully written, this is the ultimate book on the book: how it came to be and how we have come to keep it.</p><p>Consider the book. Though <i>Goodnight Moon</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i> differ considerably in content and intended audience, they do share some basic characteristics. They have pages, they're roughly the same shape, and whether in a bookstore, library, or private home, they are generally stored vertically on shelves. Indeed, this is so much the norm that in these days of high-tech printing presses and chain bookstores, it's easy to believe that the book, like the cockroach, remains much the same as it ever was. But as Henry Petroski makes abundantly clear in <i>Book on the Bookshelf</i>, books as we know them have had a long and complex evolution. Indeed, he takes us from the scroll to the codex to the hand-lettered illuminated texts that were so rare and valuable they were chained to lecterns to prevent theft. Along the way he provides plenty of amusing anecdotes about libraries (according to one possibly apocryphal account, the library at Alexandria borrowed the works of the great Greek authors from Athens, had them copied, and then sent the copies back, keeping the originals), book collectors, and the care of books. <p> Book-lover though he may be, however, Henry Petroski is, first and foremost, an engineer and so, in the end, it is the evolution of bookshelves even more than of books that fascinates him. Pigeonholes for scrolls, book presses containing thousands of chained volumes, rotating lecterns that allowed scholars to peruse more than one book at a time--these are just a few of the ingenious methods readers have devised over the centuries for storing their books: "in cabinets beneath the desks, on shelves in front of them, in triangular attic-like spaces formed under the back-to-back sloped surfaces of desktops or small tabletop lecterns that rested upon a horizontal surface." Placing books vertically on shelves, spines facing outward, is a fairly recent invention, it would seem. Well written as it is, if <i>Book on the Bookshelf</i> were <i>only</i> about books-as-furniture, it would have little appeal to the general reader. Petroski, however, uses this treatise on design to examine the very human motivations that lie behind it. From the example of Samuel Pepys, who refused to have more titles than his library could hold (about 3,000), to an appendix detailing all the ways people organize their collections (by sentimental value, by size, by color, and by price, to name a few of the more unconventional methods), Petroski peppers his account with enough human interest to keep his audience reading from cover to cover. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"For anyone interested in the craft of reading, [this book] is a compulsive necessity." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"A fascinating history of two related common objects, impeccably documented and beautifully illustrated." --<i>Civilization</i><br><br>"After reading this book, you will not look at a book or a bookshelf in the same way." --<i>Seattle Times</i><br><br>"If 'God is in the details,' then those seeking God should read Petroski's books." --<i>Library Journal</i><br></p><h2>The German Way of War: From the Thirty Years&#39; War to the Third Reich (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>For Frederick the Great, the prescription for warfare was simple: kurz und vives ("short and lively")--wars that relied upon swift, powerful, and decisive military operations. Robert Citino takes us on a dramatic march through Prussian and German military history to show how that primal theme played out time and time again.<p> </p><p>Citino focuses on operational warfare to demonstrate continuity in German military campaigns from the time of Elector Frederick Wilhelm and his great "sleigh-drive" against the Swedes to the age of Adolf Hitler and the blitzkrieg to the gates of Moscow. Along the way, he underscores the role played by the Prussian army in elevating a small, vulnerable state to the ranks of the European powers, describes how nineteenth-century victories over Austria and France made the German army the most respected in Europe, and reviews the lessons learned from the trenches of World War I.</p><p> </p><p>Through this long view, Citino reveals an essential recurrent pattern--characterized by rapid troop movements and surprise attacks, maneuvers to outflank the enemy, and a determination to annihilate the opposition--that made it possible for the Germans to fight armies often larger than their own. He highlights the aggressiveness of Prussian and German commanders--trained simply to find the enemy and keep attacking--and destroys the myth of <i>Auftragstaktik</i> ("flexible command"), replacing it with the independence of subordinate commanders. He also brings new interpretations to well-known operations, such as Moltke's 1866 campaign and the opening campaign in 1914, while intro-ducing readers to less familiar but important battles like Langensalza and the Annaberg.</p><p> </p><p>The German way of war, as Citino shows, was fostered by the development of a widely accepted and deeply embedded military culture that supported and rewarded aggression. His book offers a fresh look at one of the most remarkable, respected, and reviled militaries of the past half millennium and marks another sterling contribution to the history of operational warfare.</p><p> </p><p>This book is part of the <i>Modern War Studies</i> series.</p></p><p>"Citino combines colossal scholarship with massively entertaining material. It is all here: the great captains from Frederick the Great to Erich von Manstein, the great theorists from Clausewitz and Moltke to Schlieffen and Guderian, the pivotal battles that shaped European history, and a humanist's splendid recreation at every turn of the ambiance of the German army and Central Europe."--Geoffrey Wawro, author of <i>The Franco-Prussian War</i><p> </p><p>"Very few historians have mastered this literature as well as Citino or possess his ability to describe battles and campaigns and lay out complex operations in such a lucid manner."--James S. Corum, author of <i>The Roots of Blitzkrieg</i></p><p> </p><p>"The most up-to-date work on its subject, written with style and verve."--Arden Bucholz, author of <i>Moltke and the German Wars, 1864-1871</i></p>Robert M.

It has been the foundation of our education, and has defined the way in which we express our thoughts, our faith, and our knowledge of how the world functions. Indeed, the language has proved far more enduring than its empire in Rome, its use echoing on in the law codes of half the world, in the terminologies of modern science, and until forty years ago, in the liturgy of the Catholic Church. It is the unseen substance that makes us members of the Western world.</p><p>In his erudite and entertaining "biography," Nicholas Ostler shows how and why (against the odds, through conquest from within and without) Latin survived and thrived even as its creators and other languages failed. Originally the dialect of Rome and its surrounds, Latin supplanted its neighbors to become, by conquest and settlement, the language of all Italy, and then of Western Europe and North Africa. Its cultural creep toward Greek in the East led it to copy and then ally with it in an unprecedented, but invincible combination: Greek theory and Roman practice, delivered through Latin, became the foundation of Western civilization. Christianity, a latecomer, then joined the alliance, and became vital to Latin's survival when the empire collapsed. Spoken Latin re-emerged as a host of new languages, from Portuguese and Spanish in the west to Romanian in the east. But a knowledge of Latin lived on as the common code of European thought, and inspired the founders of Europe's New World in the Americas. <i>E pluribus unum</i>.</p><p>Illuminating the extravaganza of its past, Nicholas Ostler makes clear that, in a thousand echoes, Latin lives on, ad infinitum.</p></p><p><p><b>Nicholas Ostler</b> is the author of <i>Empires of the World: A Language History of the World</i>. He is chairman of the Foundation for Endangered Languages (www.ogmios.org), a charity that supports the efforts of small communities worldwide to know and use their languages more. A scholar with a working knowledge of twenty-six languages, Ostler has degrees from Oxford University in Greek, Latin, philosophy, and economics, and a Ph.D. in linguistics from M.I.T., where he studied under Noam Chomsky. He lives in England, in Roman Bath, on the hill where Ambrosius Aurelianus defeated the Saxons for a generation.</p>Praise for &#39;Empires of the Word&#39;: &#39;It is a compelling read, one of the most interesting books I have read in a long while!a great book.

Secondly, such beliefs are nothing more than anti-feminist propaganda pumped out by conservative research organizations with clear-cut ulterior motives. This backlash against the women's movement, she writes, "stands the truth boldly on its head and proclaims that the very steps that have elevated women's positions have actually led to their downfall." Meticulously researched, Faludi's contribution to this tumultuous debate is monumental and it earned the 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction.Winner of the National Book Critics Circle award for nonfiction, this controversial, thought-provoking, and timely book is "as groundbreaking as Simone de Beauvoir's The <i>Second Sex</i> and Betty Friedan's <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>." -- <i>Newsweek</i>.<p> "The backlash against women is real.

I don&#39;t know why my brothers and sisters complain so much. With snakes in the bath and scorpions on the lunch table, our house, on the island of Corfu, is a bit like a circus. So they should feel right at home...</p><p>As a self-described "champion of small uglies," English writer Gerald Durrell (1925-1995) devoted his life to writing and the preservation of wildlife, from the Mauritius pink pigeon to the Rodriques fruit bat. <i>My Family and Other Animals</i> was intended to embrace the natural history of the Greek island of Corfu, but ended up as a delightful account of his family's experiences that were, according to him, "rather like living in one of the more flamboyant and slapstick comic operas." <p> As a 10-year-old boy, Gerry left England for Corfu with "all those items that I thought necessary to relieve the tedium of a long journey: four books on natural history, a butterfly net, a dog, and a jam-jar full of caterpillars all in imminent danger of turning into chrysalids." Durrell's descriptions of his family and its many eccentric hangers-on (he stresses that "all the anecdotes about the island and the islanders are absolutely true") are highly entertaining, as is the procession of toads, scorpions, geckos, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, the puppies Widdle and Puke, and the Magenpies. This is a lovely book.</p>Gerald Durrell (1925-1995) moved from England to Corfu with his family at the age of eight. He spent much of his time studying the island&#39;s wildlife, and surprising his family by keeping lots of very unusual pets in very unexpected places. He grew up to be a famous naturalist and conservationalist, leading expeditions to exotic places such as Argentina, Sierra Leone, Assam and Madagascar. Over his lifetime he presented many TV shows, and wrote 37 books, including MY FAMILY AND OTHER ANIMALS and its two sequels, BIRDS, BEASTS AND RELATIVES and THE GARDEN OF THE GODS. He founded Jersey Zoo in 1959 as a centre for the conservation of endangered species, and in 1963 he created the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust - later renamed Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust - of which his wife Lee is still Honorary Director. He was awarded the OBE in 1982.</p><h2>The Shadow of the Almighty: The Life &amp; Times of Jim Elliot</h2><p>Covering every area of copywriting, Kuswa presents practicable advice on writing effective direct mail copy, sales letters, brochures, publicity releases, and speech scripts, establishing guidelines for contracting assignments and negotiating fees</p><p>Made famous by Life magazine, this is the best-selling account of the martyrdom of Jim Elliot and four other misisonaries at the hands of the Auca Indians in Ecuador.

Consistent with his style of play, Manning surveyed the defense while at the line of scrimmage, calling audibles based on what he saw before him. <br>As was often the case, Manning could do this for at least twenty-five or thirty seconds, until the play clock was about to run out. <br>Since Solarno had bet a lot of money on the Colts, and they were down by four on the Patriots&#x2019; eighteen-yard line with thirty seconds to play, he wasn&#x2019;t happy about leaving the television at all. Chances are it was just a deliveryman, and he could deal with it and be back without missing a play. At least that&#x2019;s what he hoped. <br>That&#x2019;s not how it worked out. He opened the door, and managed to get out the words &#x201c;what are you&#x201d; before the bullet hit him in the chest, sending him falling backward. <br>There was a silencer on the gun, so the killer knew that no neighbors were calling 911. Solarno was technically still alive when he hit the floor, but likely dead by the time Manning threw the interception, effectively costing the Colts the game. But that was no longer Solarno&#x2019;s problem; he wouldn&#x2019;t be paying bookmakers ever again. <br>The killer heard a noise from the top of the stairs, so he entered the house, closing the door behind him. He then headed straight up the stairs, and within three minutes ended the life of Richard&#x2019;s wife, Karen, as well. <br>That had not been part of the plan, but it had to be done. <br>&#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s on tap for today?&#x201d; <br>Laurie&#x2019;s question, while seemingly innocuous, represents something of a problem, because my &#x201c;tap&#x201d; for today is not something she is likely to approve of. <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to take Tara for a walk. Then I&#x2019;m going to run over to the market for some beer, be back here by noon for the NFL pregame shows. I&#x2019;ll call my bookie, Jimmy Rollins, at twelve thirty to bet the games; then I&#x2019;ll order a pizza. At one I&#x2019;ll watch the Giants-Redskins game, switching to other games during time-outs. <br>&#x201c;Then, at four, it&#x2019;ll be mostly San Diego against the Jets, again switching where necessary. That takes me to seven, when I&#x2019;m hoping you&#x2019;ll have dinner ready. From eight thirty to eleven thirty tonight is Dallas-Philadelphia on NBC; then, if I&#x2019;m lucky, you&#x2019;ll be in the mood for some sexual frolicking from eleven thirty until midnight.&#x201d; <br>That is what I would say if I had any semblance of courage or honesty, but since I don&#x2019;t, I opt for, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t really done a tap check for today yet, but I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll come up with something productive. Every day is a chance for a new adventure.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then let me guess,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to take Tara for a walk, get some beer, place some bets, order a pizza, and watch football all day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You make it sound really appealing,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;How did you come up with all that?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s exactly what you did yesterday.&#x201d; <br>I snap my fingers. &#x201c;I knew it sounded familiar. But yesterday was college football, today is pro. Apples and oranges.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re incorrigible.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m partially corrigible. I&#x2019;m not watching football tomorrow at all during the day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about Monday-night football?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not during the day; it&#x2019;s at night. Hence the name. Oh, and I&#x2019;m making the prison rounds Tuesday and Wednesday.&#x201d; Laurie knows what that means; I visit former clients of mine who were found guilty at trial and are in prison. I don&#x2019;t want them to think they&#x2019;ve been forgotten. <br>&#x201c;So what do you have on tap for today?&#x201d; I ask, trying to pull the old switcheroo. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going running, then a spinning class, then Pilates, and then this afternoon I&#x2019;m volunteering at the hospital.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know, I can&#x2019;t decide which of those things sounds the most awful.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got an idea, Andy.&#x201d; <br>Uh, oh. Laurie&#x2019;s ideas often involve my expending energy by actually doing things, and today I really just want to plant myself in front of the large-screen TV in the den. I&#x2019;m so looking forward to total relaxation that I bought a bag of already-popped popcorn so I don&#x2019;t have to deal with the microwave. <br>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s a long-range, down-the-road, futuristic kind of idea, because we&#x2019;re talking Giants-Redskins,&#x201d; I say. <br>&#x201c;Well, it might be a way for you to really do something productive, something that you would also enjoy.&#x201d; She quickly adds, &#x201c;But definitely not today; I understand we&#x2019;re talking Giants-Redskins.&#x201d; <br>My name, Andy Carpenter, is listed under &#x201c;Attorneys&#x201d; in the phone book, assuming phone books still exist. But since my desire to work is really low, and my bank account is really high, I haven&#x2019;t taken on any clients in almost six months, so I&#x2019;m a little leery about what Laurie might be driving at. <br>&#x201c;As long as what you&#x2019;re going to suggest doesn&#x2019;t include judges, courthouses, depositions, or briefs, and if I can bring Tara, I&#x2019;m all ears,&#x201d; I say. <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t include any of those things, and Tara&#x2019;s actually the key to it.&#x201d; <br>I relax the cringe I&#x2019;ve been doing since the conversation began. Tara is my best friend, right up there with Laurie. She is also a golden retriever, the greatest one on Earth. My interest is officially piqued. <br>She continues, &#x201c;I think you should take Tara to the hospital as a therapy dog.&#x201d; <br>This could be worse, but it ain&#x2019;t great. I know a little bit about the therapy dog process, and while I think it&#x2019;s a great thing to do, it&#x2019;s especially great for <i>other</i> people to do, with <i>other people&#x2019;s dogs</i>. <br>I can&#x2019;t speak, or bark, for Tara, but I&#x2019;m not anxious to start spending time in hospitals. <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t Tara need some special training for that?&#x201d; I ask. <br>She shakes her head. &#x201c;Not this one; I&#x2019;ve checked it out. All they require is a mellow disposition and friendliness on the part of the dog, plus human compassion. Tara is mellow and friendly, and she has enough of the human compassion part for both of you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds great. But there must be a huge waiting list for something like that. I don&#x2019;t want to cut in line.&#x201d; <br>Laurie shakes her head. &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And I suppose you&#x2019;ve already talked about it with Tara?&#x201d; <br>She nods. &#x201c;She was quite enthusiastic about it.&#x201d; <br>I look over at Tara, who does in fact seem fine with everything, and doesn&#x2019;t appear surprised. This has all the earmarks of a setup. <br>I&#x2019;m not going to win this, so I might as well try to make it pay off. &#x201c;How is this going to impact my life sexually?&#x201d; I ask. <br>Laurie smiles. &#x201c;I find the prospect of you doing this to be very erotic.&#x201d; <br>I return the smile. &#x201c;My cup of human compassion runneth over.&#x201d; <br>If I hadn&#x2019;t seen it, I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed it. <br>I&#x2019;ve been in the hospital room occupied by the very frail Mrs. Harriet Marshall for thirty-five minutes. When I got here, she seemed barely awake, and her mumbling speech was impossible to understand. <br>I told her who I was, and she showed no reaction whatsoever. I could have told her the room was on fire and I wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten a response. She was depressed, numbed, and mostly lifeless, sort of how I felt after the Redskins beat the Giants yesterday. <br>She had absolutely no interest in me, had nothing to say to me, and barely acknowledged my existence. In terms of dealing with females, it felt like I was back in high school. <br>Then Tara walked over to her, and everything changed. It took three or four minutes, during which Tara sniffed her and put her nose against her arm. <br>Harriet resisted, until Tara pulled out the big move&nbsp;&#x2026; the combination &#x201c;lean-against nuzzle, with a slight lick and an adoring glance.&#x201d; In dog-land the move has a degree of difficulty of nine point seven, and as far as I know, there is no known defense against it. <br>So within five minutes Harriet was petting Tara with both hands. She was using a &#x201c;reverse pet,&#x201d; which means she would stroke her head from front to back, and then from back to front. I know from personal experience that Tara is not a huge fan of that, but she was graciously allowing Harriet to do it. <br>The transformation has been amazing. Harriet went from silent and sullen to outgoing and borderline gregarious. In fact, I don&#x2019;t think I could shut her up if I wanted to, which I don&#x2019;t. <br>First, all she wanted to talk about was Tara, asking where I got her and whether she was always this sweet. I told her that I got her from an animal shelter seven years ago when she was two years old. <br>&#x201c;So she&#x2019;s only nine now?&#x201d; she asked. <br>Unfortunately, &#x201c;only&#x201d; is not the appropriate word. Nine years is starting to get up there for a golden. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;though in dog years that&#x2019;s fifty-two,&#x201d; I said. Many people think that each year a dog lives counts as seven, but that&#x2019;s not the correct way to figure it. The first year counts as twenty-one, and each one thereafter counts as four. <br>The entire concept would be depressing if not for the fact that Tara is going to live forever. <br>&#x201c;Fifty-two? I&#x2019;ve got stockings older than that.&#x201d; Then she laughed, and I was immediately glad that I let Laurie talk me into doing this. <br>She went on to tell me everything about every one of her relatives, and she has about thirty thousand of them. Her granddaughter Cynthia just won a regional spelling bee, but the region was in Seattle, so Harriet was bummed that she didn&#x2019;t get to go. <br>&#x201c;Do you have family around here?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do they come to visit?&#x201d; <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;They want to, but I don&#x2019;t let them. I&#x2019;m too busy feeling sorry for myself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re sick?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know what was wrong with her, so it was a question I probably shouldn&#x2019;t have asked. <br>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m old, and because things in my body don&#x2019;t work like they should anymore.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not afraid of death, but dying is going to be a pain in the ass.&#x201d; <br>We&#x2019;ve talked for over an hour, and I really don&#x2019;t want to leave, but she&#x2019;s clearly getting tired, so I put Tara&#x2019;s leash on her to lead her out. <br>&#x201c;Will you come back to see me?&#x201d; Harriet asks. <br>&#x201c;Definitely.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll bring Tara?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll bring me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I had a dog when I was growing up,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Her name was Sarah. I remember everything about her.&#x201d; She laughs. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t remember a single boyfriend; hell, I can&#x2019;t remember what I had for breakfast today. But I remember everything about Sarah.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dogs are the best,&#x201d; I say. <br>She nods and pets Tara&#x2019;s head for the thousandth time. &#x201c;And Tara&#x2019;s the best of the best. Just like Sarah.&#x201d; <br>I nod. &#x201c;Exactly like Sarah.&#x201d; <br>The prison up in Rahway is maybe my least favorite place on Earth, with the possible exception of Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. Actually, the two places remind me of each other. For starters, they&#x2019;re both enormous, often overcrowded, and serve mediocre food. <br>Rahway houses murderers and thieves, the lowest of the low, worthy of society&#x2019;s scorn and revenge. The stadium in Philadelphia houses the Philadelphia Eagles. <br>Six of one, half a dozen of the other. <br>I&#x2019;m heading for the prison, as I promised Laurie, but keeping that promise is not my motivation. I have friends here, friends that rely on me. Unfortunately, relying on me is part of the reason they&#x2019;re here in the first place. <br>I&#x2019;ve had a very successful legal career; you can count the number of cases I&#x2019;ve lost on one hand. Well, actually it&#x2019;s more like two or three hands, and a couple of feet. But I know defense attorneys who can&#x2019;t remember the last time they won a case, and I&#x2019;m actually on a winning streak. <br>But the losses bug me, especially in cases where I truly felt the client was innocent. <br>I&#x2019;m financially independent now, and therefore able to pick and choose from prospective clients. Mostly I choose not to work at all, but if I do, it&#x2019;s only because I consider the person innocent of the crime they&#x2019;re charged with. In my older, poorer days, I didn&#x2019;t have that luxury, so sometimes I&#x2019;d wind up with guilty clients, and, more often than not, the jury sealed the deal. <br>But Joey Desimone was different. He stood accused of the cold-blooded murder of a husband and wife in Montclair. The evidence was clearly against him, and I understood the jury&#x2019;s finding him guilty, but every instinct I had said he didn&#x2019;t do it. <br>Weighing heavily in the jurors&#x2019; minds, though they would never admit it and the judge specifically told them not to consider it, was the fact that Joey is the son of Carmine Desimone, the head of an organized crime family in Central Jersey. <br>Joey was widely thought to have distanced himself from his family&#x2019;s &#x201c;occupation,&#x201d; and I believed then, and still do, that he had nothing to do with the criminal enterprise. But it was a mark against him, as was the fact that Joey was having an affair with the woman who died in the attack, Karen Solarno. <br>Public outrage at the crime was widespread; I was even castigated for representing him. The jury climbed on the anti-Joey bandwagon and gave him life without the possibility of parole. They would have given him the death penalty, but New Jersey doesn&#x2019;t have one. Joey&#x2019;s continuing to live actually became an issue in the next gubernatorial campaign, with one of the candidates pointing to it as a prime reason for a reinstatement of the ultimate punishment. <br>That candidate lost, and retreated to his previous post on Wall Street. Joey, in the meantime, spends twenty-three of every twenty-four hours sitting in a seven-by-ten-foot cell. <br>So I visit him. Not that often, maybe three or four times a year, and not for any reason other than to let him know he&#x2019;s not forgotten. Early on I could see the look of hope on his face that I was bringing him some news that might help get him out of prison, and then the disappointment when that obviously wasn&#x2019;t the case. <br>Now we just have easy conversations, friends talking about whatever. He&#x2019;s managed to keep up to date on the news of the day, especially sports, so the conversation flows smoothly. <br>I don&#x2019;t bother asking him how things are in the prison anymore. The answer is always a shrug and &#x201c;getting by.&#x201d; I know that he doesn&#x2019;t get hassled by other inmates, for a few reasons. First of all, he minds his own business. Second, he&#x2019;s a former Marine who can handle himself as well as anyone in the place. <br>Third, and by far the most important, everyone knows who his father is. Joey has often told me how distressed his father is that his son is behind bars, and that he was unable to prevent it. He is, however, more than powerful enough to have effectively put the word out that Joey is not to be messed with. <br>Joey is a football Giants fan, another mark in his favor, but he takes it to a level well past me. I know who the starters are, and am generally aware of their strengths and weaknesses. Joey knows everyone on the roster, including the practice squad, and he can talk at length about any one of them. Which is fine, because when it comes to football talk, I can listen at length. <br>I mention my experience with Tara, the Therapy Dog, and Joey finds it hilarious. &#x201c;So you bring a dog right into the hospital? Isn&#x2019;t that unsanitary or something?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Unsanitary? Tara?&#x201d; I ask. &#x201c;You start talking trash about Tara and it won&#x2019;t do you any good to smile when you say it.&#x201d; <br>He laughs, apparently not cowed by my threat. &#x201c;Sorry, but I can&#x2019;t picture it. The world has changed a lot since I&#x2019;ve been in here.&#x201d; <br>He probably doesn&#x2019;t know how true that is, but I decide that his comment is not banter material, so I don&#x2019;t try it. &#x201c;I doubted it myself, but the first person I did it with, Tara really made her feel better. It&#x2019;s like she came alive.&#x201d; <br>His eyes light up with an idea. &#x201c;Hey, does the person have to be in a hospital?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t think so. Could be an old...</p><h2>Till There Was You (Macleod Family)</h2><p>Zachary Smith is finished with high-maintenance women, impossible clients, and paranormal adventures.

A collection of interviews with top traders gives insights into their stories of extraordinary investment success. Learn how these pros converted financial set-backs into greater-than-ever riches.</p><p><br><br> <b>Q &amp; A with Jack D. Schwager, author of <i>Market Wizards: Interviews with Top Traders</i></b><br><br> <b>More than twenty years have passed since the first edition of this book was released. Is it as relevant today as it was then?</b><br> Absolutely. Markets may change and the specific techniques or systems that work best may change, but the underlying core principles that lead to trading success stay the same. And there is a good reason for that. Through all periods, market price moves reflect some combination of underlying fundamentals and human behavior. Since human nature doesn't change, the market's basic behavioral patterns don't change either. I believe that every conclusion I reached about the factors important to trading success in the first edition remains equally valid today. Perhaps the best testament to the continued relevance of <i>Market Wizards</i> in today's markets is that so many of the managers I meet who read the original edition early in their careers make it required reading for new traders in their organization.<br><br> <b>Has trading fundamentally changed with the rise of the quants and algorithmic traders? </b><br> The growing role of algorithmic trading may have eliminated some market inefficiencies as sources of profitable strategies, and it may even have impacted the efficacy of some trading systems, but I don't believe it has changed fundamental market behavior. The same basic concepts that are critical to trading success remain as valid now as they were a generation ago when computerized trading was in its infancy.<br><br> <b>What are these basic concepts?</b><br> Well that's what this book is all about. But to offer one example, I believe that developing a trading methodology that fits your personality, as opposed to seeking someone else's approach, is an absolutely critical element to succeeding as a trader.<br><br> <b>Why do most traders fail?</b><br> There are many reasons. They seek easy answers. They listen to "experts" and chase trading fads instead of doing the hard work of developing their own methodology. They focus almost all their energy on determining trade entry points and all but ignore the more critical questions of trade exit and risk management. They listen to other people. These are a few of the reasons. Readers will find a lot more in the book.<br><br> <b>Which trader interview in the book has been the most popular?</b><br> Readers will often tell me that a certain chapter was their favorite and by far the most important in improving their own trading. The interesting thing is that they always seem to mention a different trader. There is no consensus. Different readers will find different things in the book important. They will relate to different traders. It all goes back to the importance of finding your own approach in the market.<br><br> <b>Have the interviews you did for <i>Market Wizards</i> been important to your own trading?</b><br> The interview and writing process has helped solidify in my own mind the principles that are important to trading success. At times, it has also had a very specific influence. A great example occurred last summer. At the time, the stock market was approaching the high end of a long-term trading range, and for a variety of reasons, I expected the rally to fail and was positioned on the short side of stock index futures. Then the government released an extremely bearish employment report. It was so negative that commentators couldn't even cite one offsetting bullish consideration, as they usually do. The market initially sold off sharply in response--"perfect," I thought of my trade--but by the end of the day, it nearly recovered the entire loss, ending the week near the recent high. From the perspective of a short, this was terrible price action. I thought I was in trouble. I was prepared to cover most of my position when the market opened on Sunday night. On Sunday night, however, the market opened lower. I immediately thought of Marty Schwartz's advice in this book: "If you're very nervous about a position overnight, and especially over the weekend, and you're able to get out at a much better price than you thought when the market trades, you're usually better off staying with the position." I did, and Schwartz's insight saved me a lot of money, as the market proceeded to move sharply lower in the ensuing weeks.<br><br><p>How do some of the world's most successful traders amass millions of dollars in a year&#x2014;or sometimes in hours? Are they masters of a priceless wizardry or simply the very lucky winners in a random market lottery that allows only a few players to become fantastically wealthy? What are the secrets of their unheard-of successes? And what mental disciplines, what emotional responses, what intangible personal ingredients make these top traders so mysteriously effective? What enables them to work financial magic while so many others walk away losers?</p> <p>Featuring interviews with seventeen of the most successful market-beaters, including Bruce Kovner, Richard Dennis, Paul Tudor Jones, Michael Steinhardt, Ed Seykota, Marty Schwartz, and Tom Baldwin, <i>Market Wizards</i> is packed with real-life anecdotes from the trading world. From the electrical engineer from MIT whose computerized trading earned returns of 250,000% over sixteen years to the trader who, after wiping out several times, successfully turned a $30,000 investment into an $80 million fortune, Schwager identifies the factors that define the Market Wizards.</p> <p><i>Market Wizards</i> takes the reader into the minds of a few of the most successful traders of all time, explaining that while markets may change and techniques may change, the underlying core principles that lead to trading success stay the same. The best testament to the continued relevance of <i>Market Wizards</i> in today's markets is that so many money managers who read the original edition early in their careers make it required reading for new traders.</p></p><h2>A Siege of Bitterns: A Birder Murder Mystery</h2><p><b>Newly appointed police inspector Domenic Jejeune doesn&#x2019;t mind ruffling a few feathers to flush out suspects in the brutal murder of a renowned ecological activist.</b><br> <br> <i>2015 Arthur Ellis Award &#x2015; Winner, Best First Novel � Globe and Mail 100: Best Books of 2014 � 2015 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize &#x2015; Shortlisted, Best Mystery</i><br> <br> Inspector Domenic Jejeune&#x2019;s success has made him a poster boy for the U.K. police service.

He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan.

It is a saga of two opposing wills that would later clash in a storm of violence and betrayal, a story straight from the pages of history that brings the world of the thirteenth century comletely, provocatively, and magnificently alive.

What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p><p>Sharon Kay Penman is the author of six critically acclaimed historical novels and four medieval mysteries, one of which was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America.</p></p><h2>Alchemy (Dover Books on Engineering)</h2><p><p>Alchemy is thought to have originated over 2000 years ago in Hellenic Egypt, the result of three converging streams: Greek philosophy, Egyptian technology and the mysticism of Middle Eastern religions. Its heyday was from about 800 A.D. to the middle of the seventeenth century, and its practitioners ranged from kings, popes, and emperors to minor clergy, parish clerks, smiths, dyers, and tinkers. Even such accomplished men as Roger Bacon, Thomas Aquinas, Sir Thomas Browne and Isaac Newton took an interest in alchemical matters.<br>In its search for the "Philosopher's Stone" that would transmute base metals into silver and gold, alchemy took on many philosophical, religious and mystical overtones. These and many other facets of alchemy are explored with enormous insight and erudition in this classic work. E. J. Holmyard, a noted scholar in the field, begins with the alchemists of ancient Greece and China and goes on to discuss alchemical apparatus, Islamic and early Western alchemy; signs, symbols, and secret terms; Paracelsus; English, Scottish and French alchemists; Helvetius, Price, and Semler, and much more.<br>Ranging over two millennia of alchemical history, Mr. Holmyard shows how, like astrology and witchcraft, alchemy was an integral part of the pre-scientific moral order, arousing the cupidity of princes, the blind fear of mobs and the intellectual curiosity of learned men. Eventually, however, with the advent and ascension of the scientific method, the hopes and ideas of the alchemists faded to the status of "pseudo-science." That transformation, as well as alchemy's undeniable role as a precursor of modern chemistry, are brilliantly illuminated in this book. Students of alchemy, chemistry, the history of science, and the occult, plus anyone interested in the origin and evolution of one of mankind's most enduring and influential myths, will want to have a copy of this masterly study.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The DASH Diet for Hypertension</h2><p>From Dr. Thomas Moore and a team of top doctors and nutritionists from Harvard, Duke, and Johns Hopkins medical schools comes the guide to the DASH diet, which is scientifically proven to significantly reduce high blood pressure!<br><br>More than 50 million Americans suffer from high blood pressure, and most of them control it by taking prescription drugs with potentially dangerous side effects. But there is a natural, affordable, and easy-to-manage alternative to medication: the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Developed by a world-class team of doctors and nutritionists, the DASH diet is clinically proven to lower blood-pressure levels and thereby reduce the risk of heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. Now, with <i>The DASH Diet for Hypertension,</i> readers can benefit from:<br> <br>� A hearty and healthful selection of DASH menus, recipes, even grocery lists<br> � DASH weight-loss and exercise programs for everyday living<br> � The science behind DASH, including calorie worksheets and a formula to calculate body-mass<br> <br>...and much more from this revolutionary program, which is recommended by the American Heart Association; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; the American Society for Hypertension; and other leading medical authorities.</p><p><i>The DASH Diet for Hypertension</i>, recommended by the American Heart Association, has been shown in studies to lower blood pressure in two weeks without the use of drugs. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy; includes moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and nuts; and reduces consumption of red meat and sweets. Studies from the National Institutes of Health followed 800 participants and found that the DASH diet lowered blood pressure as much as typical medication.<p> This is no quirky diet--it's the way the major medical groups have been advising us to eat all along, but with a specific formula that tells you how many servings to eat from each Food Pyramid food group. You also get suggestions for exercising moderately, losing weight, reducing salt, and food shopping.</p><p> Included are two weeks of daily menus and 62 recipes, with modified favorites like Macaroni and Cheese and Sweet and Sour Pork with Vegetables, plus innovative dishes such as Mango/Black Bean Salad with Grilled Shrimp and Sweet-Potato Chips (baked). The authors are medical hypertension experts associated with Harvard and Duke medical centers. Recommended for people who want to lower their blood pressure or just eat more healthfully. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Mark Jenkins is a journalist and the author of several health books, including the <i>Sports Medicine Bible</i>, and is a consultant to the Harvard Medical School system.<br><br>Thomas J.

Coming from similar backgrounds, they shared the same values and were passionately committed to standing up to the Soviet challenge with covert action. In this excellent group biography, Thomas (The Man to See), assistant managing editor and bureau chief at Newsweek, describes how they waged their secret war boldly, sometimes recklessly, and reveals how each was caught between his own sense of decency and the harsh dictates of his trade. In their roles in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the agency's involvement with the Mafia and the bizarre attempts to get rid of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, they were unable to reconcile themselves to the moral ambiguities of the job. Thomas is the first outsider to be given access to the CIA's own secret histories, and there is much new material here on agency operations, especially in relation to Cuba.

All he knew was that the big bird was his partner and had arrived as some kind of gift from the arctic where it thrived and now he was hunting with it.</p><p>The falcon was stocky and thick the first time he lifted it up on his glove, and it weighed more than any raptor he&#x2019;d ever flown.&nbsp; It was smaller than a golden or bald eagle but not by much, maybe a pound or two less.&nbsp; When it was in the air, its five-foot wingspan and mottled white coloring reminded Nate of a flying white wolf.&nbsp; In the dawn of the desert, when the first shafts of the sun lit up the gyrfalcon in flight, its coloring made it look twice as big as it actually was.&nbsp; The gyrfalcon was a formidable weapon.&nbsp; If a peregrine was a cruise missile, Nate thought, the gyrfalcon was a Stealth bomber.</p><p>Gyrfalcons had been reserved for royalty in ancient times.&nbsp; Commoners couldn&#x2019;t fly them.&nbsp; It was a miracle that the big white bird had shown up.&nbsp; She was a big female, almost silver in color, and females of the species were larger than males.&nbsp; He enjoyed simply staring at her when she was on the glove, and she seemed to enjoy &#x2013; and expect &#x2013; his admiration.&nbsp;</p><p>Because his new bird had no natural predators except the occasional golden eagle, it flew and hunted with impunity.</p><p>So when it flared sharply upwards a mile and a half away and immediately started climbing, when its long wings blurred with effort as they worked hard and fast to ascend from the threat, Nate knew the raptor had encountered something deadly and unusual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Whatever was</b> approaching also attracted the attention of a small herd of pronghorns to his right.&nbsp; He&#x2019;d not seen the creatures previously in the dark, but there they were.&nbsp; As one, the animals froze and turned their heads to the north where the falcon had flared.&nbsp; After a beat, a secret signal was given and the herd came alive and took off to the south.&nbsp; Small puffs of dust rose in their wake from twin teardrop-shaped hooves.&nbsp; The pronghorns moved away like molten liquid flowing across the desert until they were gone.</p><p>Then Nate felt a vibration through the ground itself.&nbsp; It was remarkable in the desert how he could feel something coming before he could see or hear it.</p><p>A motley herd of twelve or thirteen shaggy horses thundered over the wide northern horizon.&nbsp; One by one they appeared, manes flying and nostrils flared.&nbsp; The rhythm of their hoof beats increased in volume and they were far enough away that the sound was disconnected from their movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Something was driving them, he knew.&nbsp; Something had spooked them into running straight at him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>The horses</b> came toward him over the hard-pan, kicking up a spoor of dust that hung in the air behind them.&nbsp; They were getting close enough now &#x2013; maybe a hundred and fifty yards away &#x2013; that the sound of their pounding hooves started to sync with their movement.</p><p>He wondered if the herd was going to run right over the top of him.</p><p>Nate raised both of his hands in the air and waved his arms.&nbsp; The herd kept coming.&nbsp;</p><p>Not until they were twenty-five yards away did the animals part and run by him on both sides.&nbsp; The ground shook.&nbsp; Before he closed his eyes against the dust, he caught glimpses of white-tinged eyes, flared nostrils, matted manes, and scabbed-over wounds on their flanks.&nbsp; They were sorrels, mostly, but the lead stallion was black with a single white sock. Their smell lingered after they&#x2019;d gone, a heavy musk that was part dried sweat, part caked mud.</p><p>They continued to thunder south.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>When he</b> opened his eyes, he saw a pair of headlights, like pinpricks, poke through the hanging dust where the horses had appeared on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>Nate squinted, trying to see better.&nbsp; The vehicle, like the horses, was coming right at him.</p><p>He turned and scanned the cloudless sky.&nbsp; The gyrfalcon was a tiny white speck against the powder blue.&nbsp; Nate knew the difference between a falcon rising in a thermal current for a better hunting lane or circling for an angle of attack, and when it was flying away.&nbsp;</p><p>The gyrfalcon was flying away.&nbsp; He knew in his heart he&#x2019;d never see it again.</p><p>He&#x2019;d had the experience before.&nbsp; Sometimes falcons that he&#x2019;d spent years feeding, training, and hunting simply flew away.&nbsp; Each time it happened, it opened a hole inside him that could only be filled by a new raptor.&nbsp; But this time he didn&#x2019;t feel loss as much as a sense of betrayal.&nbsp; His thought was:</p><p><i>The bitch set me up</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Then he</b> turned to the oncoming vehicle and was surprised to find it had divided into three parts.&nbsp; What he&#x2019;d initially assumed to be a single four-wheel drive unit was now three, and he realized that what he&#x2019;d first seen was the lead truck in a small convoy of pickups.&nbsp; The two trucks behind the lead vehicle had flared out to its flanks and they were coming at him in an arrowhead formation trailed by plumes of dust that lit up orange in the morning sun.</p><p>Three pickups coming fast.</p><p>He could now hear the sounds of their motors revving and their tires crunching volcanic silica on the desert surface.</p><p>Within a minute, he could see that in addition to the drivers there were men in the backs of the trucks.&nbsp; As the vehicles approached, the men in back rose warily, trying to keep their balance as they got closer.&nbsp; They steadied themselves on the sidewalls or roof of the pickups with one hand and held long guns in their other hands.&nbsp;</p><p>The lead pickup had something large, black, and bloody attached to the top of the hood.&nbsp; Nate caught a glimpse of long yellow teeth and blood-matted hair...</p><p>He glanced down.&nbsp; There were revolvers holstered under each arm, curved grips out.&nbsp; The weapon under his right arm was a five-shot single-action .454 Casull.&nbsp; The weapon under his left was a .500 Wyoming Express, also a single-action, also manufactured by Freedom Arms, also with five big rounds in the chamber.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t remember when he&#x2019;d started sporting two guns, but he didn&#x2019;t question his decision.&nbsp; Just like he couldn&#x2019;t recall the circumstances of the gyrfalcon making itself available to him.&nbsp;</p><p>Or why he was in the desert.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder.&nbsp; He thought he&#x2019;d driven out his <i>Yarak Inc.</i> white panel van, but he was surprised to find out it had turned into his ancient Jeep CJ5.&nbsp; The Jeep was parked a quarter of a mile away under a rock formation that resembled an umbrella: a ten-ton slab of sandstone balanced somehow on a single narrow column of rock.&nbsp;</p><p>He scanned the outcropping for a sign of his friend Joe Pickett.&nbsp; Nate wasn&#x2019;t sure why, but he thought Joe would be there backing him up.&nbsp; Not that Joe could hit anything, but he meant well and he could be surprisingly ferocious when he thought he was in the right.</p><p>But was he in the right?&nbsp; Were <i>either</i> of them?&nbsp; It was confusing.</p><p>Nate doubted he could turn and run to the Jeep and get it started before the three pickups converged on him.&nbsp; Plus, he refused to be run down like a dog or shot in the back.</p><p>So he turned back around and set his feet into a shooting stance and squared his shoulders. Tiny beads of volcanic silica crunched under his boots as he got ready.</p><p>He knew what he had to do.&nbsp; He had no choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Nate did</b> the math. Three drivers, three or four armed passengers in the back of each pickup.&nbsp; Actually, the lead truck had four in the back and two in the cab, he now saw.&nbsp; So as many as fourteen armed men.</p><p>He had ten live rounds before he had to reload.&nbsp; And by then, they&#x2019;d be on top of him.</p><p>He reached across his body with both hands and pulled his weapons.&nbsp; With the muzzles pointed down, he thumbed back the hammers.</p><p>They were now fifty yards away and closing fast.&nbsp; The morning air was filled with the sound of shouting men &#x2013; Nate recognized the language and what they were yelling -- and the snapping metal-on-metal <i>snicks</i> of semi-automatic rifles being armed.</p><p>The sun lit up their olive-colored faces and electrified the barrels of their weapons.&nbsp; Most wore black beards.&nbsp; He knew the driver of the lead pickup, and he thought he shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised it was <i>him</i>.</p><br><p><b>Chapter Two </b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Nate woke</b> up with a start and a shout and sat bolt upright in bed.&nbsp; His eyes were wide and his bare skin was beaded with sweat and strands of his long blonde hair stuck to his neck and shoulders.</p><p>Olivia Brannan turned around from where she&#x2019;d been packing a suitcase on an old pine dresser.&nbsp; She&#x2019;d chosen not to turn on the light so as not to disturb him while he slept and she&#x2019;d been using the ambient light from the hallway to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you okay, babe?&#x201d; she asked, arching her eyebrows.</p><p>&#x201c;I had a bad dream,&#x201d; Nate said, his heart still racing.&nbsp; He realized that both of his fists were clenched around imaginary pistol grips under the covers.&nbsp; He stretched his fingers out and placed his hands on his knees.</p><p>&#x201c;Obviously.&nbsp; Are you better now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dandy,&#x201d; he lied.</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t sound like it,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>Liv Brannan spoke with a soft Louisiana cadence that always seemed to wrap him in a warm blanket.&nbsp; Sometimes, he asked her questions to which he knew the answers.

Mack, M.D.<br>"Fascinating, suggestive, and even inspiring."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>"A TRANSCENDENT, LANDMARK WORK...An extraordinarily rich and strange mind-expanding book.--Boston Herald<br>When respected Harvard psychiatrist John E. Mack, M.D., first published these astonishing results of four years of intensive research and investigation into alien abduction, he unleashed a firestorm of controversy. Now, in this paperback edition, Mack answers his critics, both believers and skeptics. Mack focuses on thirteen ordinary Americans (from nearly one hundred case studies) who tell dramatic, inspiring, and remarkably similar stories: repeated visits from large-eyed beings, mysterious machines, telepathy, invasive medical procedures, hours missing from their lives, and startling messages about the future....<br>"Provocative...This book is a challenge to any reader. It raises questions about how we live on this planet and with each other that the Western mind and culture will not be able to ignore for too much longer. It also raises questions about the nature of reality; of time, space, energy and the true nature of humanness. It opens the door to a very serious redefinition of life as we know it."<br>--Los Angeles Times Book Review<br>"Strange and disturbing...Something is powering this rash of abduction claims, making it worth the kind of serious investigation Mack presents here.--San Francisco Chronicle<br>"A groundbreaking study...Credible and thought-provoking."<br>--Publishers Weekly<br>A FEATURED SELECTION OF THE LITERARY GUILD</p><p>An esteemed professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, Dr. John Mack never intended to become an expert in the controversial study of alien abductees. But after investigating over 60 cases of alien abduction through hundreds of hours of interviews and treatment, Dr. Mack now presents the mesmerizing tales of alien encounters revealed by his patients-- none of whom are mentally ill-- and the profound, surprising and at times deeply spiritual impact these experiences have has on their lives. Providing details of alien encounters never before reported or depicted on the screen, the men and women whose experiences are related here in unforgettably vivid detail are not extremists recounting dreams or hallucinations. Rather, as Dr. Mack reports, they are survivors of harrowing, real-life experiences that challenge the most basic assumptions that make up our understanding of our existence and our role in the universe.ENDJohn E.

The task is no longer so simple, given the wide diversity of cultures in contemporary America. Today more than ever, in our rapidly changing world, it is important to know how to conduct oneself with confidence and grace.

Authors Tuckerman and Dunnan provide steady guidance on these and other social matters, advising readers where old expectations still apply and where customs have changed. In the business world, now that women hold high-ranking positions, men and women must look beyond the old rules that governed relations between the sexes. The new rules for the workplace are discussed in this book. Also new to The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette are such topics as planning and running a benefit, the human side of money, and the role of the guest at a wedding and at a formal dinner party.

Yesterday he was a duke, a chief of police and the ambassador to the mysterious, fat-rich country of Uberwald. Now he has nothing but his native wit and the gloomy trousers of Uncle Vanya (don&#x2019;t ask). It&#x2019;s snowing. It&#x2019;s freezing. And there are monsters on his trail . . .</p><p>Terry Pratchett has a seemingly endless capacity for generating inventively comic novels about the Discworld and its inhabitants, but there is in the hearts of most of his admirers a particular place for those novels that feature the hard-bitten captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, Samuel Vimes. Sent as ambassador to the Northern principality of Uberwald where they mine gold, iron, and fat--but never silver--he is caught up in an uneasy truce between dwarfs, werewolves, and vampires in the theft of the Scone of Stone (a particularly important piece of dwarf bread) and in the old werewolf custom of giving humans a short start in the hunt and then cheating.<p> Pratchett is always at his best when the comedy is combined with a real sense of jeopardy that even favorite characters might be hurt if there was a good joke in it. As always, the most unlikely things crop up as the subjects of gags--Chekhov, grand opera, the Caine Mutiny--and as always there are remorselessly funny gags about the inevitability of story: </p><p> </p><blockquote>They say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains. <p> No one actually saw it land, which raised the interesting philosophical question: when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky, and there is no one to hear it, does it--philosophically speaking--make a noise? </p><p> As for the dwarfs, whose legend it is, and who mine a lot deeper than other people, they say that there is a grain of truth in it.</p></blockquote><p> All this, the usual guest appearances, and Gaspode the Wonder Dog. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>TERRY PRATCHETT is the acclaimed creator of the global bestselling Discworld series, the first of which, <i>The Colour of Magic</i>, was published in 1983.

Contrary to other popular weight loss books, most notably those, such as <i>The Atkins&#x2019; Diet</i> and <i>The South Beach Diet</i>, that tout a low-carbohydrate approach to achieving weight loss, the Youngs maintain that the primary culprit behind excessive weight gain, as well as many other health problems, is a chronic state of acidity in the body (a pH value below 7.1). Shifting the body&#x2019;s chemistry to a more alkaline pH, they maintain, will quickly and easily result in the loss of excess weight and the buildup of more lean muscle tissue. <p> The goal outlined by the Youngs in this book is to replace dieting with a 12-week, seven-step program that is intended to not only rejuvenate the entire body by replacing current blood cells with blood cells "at the peak of health," but also to create an ongoing lifestyle that will permanently keep off the pounds that were shed during the 12-week period. In addition to a rich section on eating tips to create more alkalinity in the body (complete with an extensive list of recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus), the book also covers the importance of adequate water drinking, proper exercise, important nutritional supplements, learning how to manage thoughts and emotions that can contribute to acidity, goal-setting, and, for optimum results, a two-week cleansing program. In support of the program, the book also includes a collection of testimonials from people who have achieved significant weight loss on the program&#x2014;further backed up by before-and-after photographs. With an increasing number of health professionals now emphasizing the importance of proper pH to overall health, the information this book presents is both timely and fairly easy to implement. <i>Larry Trivieri Jr.</i></p>AUTHORBIO: ROBERT O.

Kahl fled and was killed in a gunfight five months later. Concoran, who covered these events as a journalist, tells an illuminating and chilling story of the growth of violence-prone, right-wing hate groups which feed on the farm crisis facing Middle America. See Bruce Brown's The Lone Tree Tragedy (LJ 6/15/89) for another case of rural violence.--Ed.. The murderous activities of fundamentalist neo-Nazis like Kahl deserve wide exposure.

Is it, as some have declared, necessarily more hurtful than other racial epithets? Do blacks have a right to use <i>nigger </i>even as others do not? Should the law view <i>nigger</i> baiting as a provocation strong enough to reduce the culpability of a person who responds violently to it? Should a person be fired from his or her job for saying <i>nigger</i>? How might the destructiveness of <i>nigger</i> be assuaged?<br><br>To be ignorant of the meanings and effects of <i>nigger</i>, says Kennedy, is to render oneself vulnerable to all manner of peril. This book brilliantly and sensitively addresses that concern.</p><p><i>Nigger</i> is Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy's ornate, lively monograph on what he calls the "paradigmatic" racial slur in the English language. A neutral noun in the 17th century, <i>nigger</i> had, by 1830, become an "influential" insult. Kennedy traces the word's history in literature, song, film, politics, sports, everyday speech, and the courtroom. He also discusses its plastic, contradictory, and volatile place in contemporary American society. Should it be eradicated from dictionaries and the language? Should it be, somehow, regulated? What is the significance of its emergence among some blacks as a term with "undertones of warmth and good will"? Do blacks have a historical right to its use or does that place the term under a "protectionist pall"? With courage and grave measure Kennedy has, in effect, created a forum for discussion of the word he calls a "reminder of the ironies and dilemmas, the tragedies and glories, of the American experience." <i>--H. O'Billovitch</i>"[Kennedy] can make [legal] decisions and reversed reversals into tense intellectual drama. . . . He's made his case: that this 'troublesome' word is only a word. And that words--like people--can always change."&#x2014;<i>Newsweek<br></i><br>"The best way to get rid of a problem is to hold it up to the bright light and look at all sides of it, and that's what Kennedy does in this book. He takes a lot of poison out of the word while he's doing it. . . . This is the way to get rid of words like 'nigger' and all the contemptible ideas that go with it."&#x2014;Andy Rooney, "60 Minutes"<br><br>"Calm, correct, informative."&#x2014;<i>The New York Observer</i><br><br>"Kennedy's commitment to racial justice is plain, and so is his impatience with the subverting of empiricism by the theatrics of the underdog. . . . He frequently throws the cold water of common sense upon issues that are too often cloaked in glib histrionics."&#x2014;<i>The New Republic</i></p><h2>Tokyo Vice</h2><p>From the only American journalist ever to have been admitted to the insular Tokyo Metropolitan Police press club: a unique, firsthand, revelatory look at Japanese culture from the underbelly up. <br><br>At nineteen, Jake Adelstein went to Japan in search of peace and tranquility. What he got was a life of crime . . . crime reporting, that is, at the prestigious <i>Yomiuri Shinbun</i>. For twelve years of eighty-hour workweeks, he covered the seedy side of Japan, where extortion, murder, human trafficking, and corruption are as familiar as ramen noodles and sake. But when his final scoop brought him face to face with Japan&#x2019;s most infamous <i>yakuza</i> boss&#x2014;and the threat of death for him and his family&#x2014;Adelstein decided to step down . . . momentarily. Then, he fought back.<br><br>In <i>Tokyo Vice</i>, Adelstein tells the riveting, often humorous tale of his journey from an inexperienced cub reporter&#x2014;who made rookie mistakes like getting into a martial-arts battle with a senior editor&#x2014;to a daring, investigative journalist with a price on his head. With its vivid, visceral descriptions of crime in Japan and an exploration of the world of modern-day <i>yakuza</i> that even few Japanese ever see, <i>Tokyo Vice</i> is a fascination, and an education, from first to last.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Jake Adelstein</strong> <br> <p> <b>Question:</b> What drew you to Japan in the first place, and how did you wind up going to university there?</p> <p><b>Jake Adelstein:</b> In high school I had many problems with anger and self-control. I had been studying Zen Buddhism and karate, and I thought Japan would be the perfect place to reinvent myself. It could be that my pointy right ear draws me toward neo-Vulcan pursuits--I don&#x2019;t know.</p> <p>When I got to Japan, I managed to find lodgings in a Soto Zen Buddhist temple where I lived for three years, attending zazen meditation at least once a week. I didn&#x2019;t become enlightened, but I did get a better hold on myself. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How did you become a journalist for the most popular Japanese-language newspaper? </p> <p><b>Jake Adelstein:</b> The <i>Yomiuri Shinbun</i> runs a standardized test, open to all college students. Many Japanese firms hire young grads this way. My friends thought that the idea of a white guy trying to pass a Japanese journalist&#x2019;s exam was so impossibly quixotic that I wanted to prove them wrong. I spent an entire year eating instant ramen and studying. I managed to find the time to do it by quitting my job as an English teacher and working as a Swedish-massage therapist for three overworked Japanese women two days a week. It turned out to be a slightly sleazy gig, but it paid the bills. </p> <p>There was a point when I was ready to give up studying and the application process. Then, when I was in Kabukicho on June 22, 1992, I asked a tarot fortune-telling machine for advice on my career path, and it said that with my overpowering morbid curiosity I was destined to become a journalist, a job at which I would flourish, and that fate would be on my side. I took that as a good sign. I still have the printout. </p> <p>I did well enough on the initial exam to get to the interviews, and managed to stumble my way through that process and get hired. I think I was an experimental case that turned out reasonably well. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> How did you succeed in uncovering the underworld in a country that is famously "closed" or restricted to foreigners? Do you think people talked more openly to you because you were American?</p> <p><b>Jake Adelstein:</b> I think Japan is actually more open than people give it credit for. However, to get the door open, you really need to become fluent in the spoken and written language. The written language was a nightmare for me.</p> <p>You&#x2019;re right, though; it was mostly an advantage to be a foreigner--it made me memorable. The <i>yakuza</i> are outsiders in Japanese society, and perhaps being a fellow outsider gave us a weird kind of bond. The cops investigating the <i>yakuza</i> also tend to be oddballs. I was mentored into an early understanding and appreciation of the code of both the <i>yakuza</i> and the cops. Reciprocity and honor are essential components for both. </p> <p>I also think the fact that I&#x2019;m too stupid to be afraid when I should be, and annoyingly persistent as well--these things didn&#x2019;t help me in long-term romance, but they helped me as a crime reporter. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Do you feel that investigative journalism is being threatened or aided by the expansion of the Internet and news blogs, and the closing down of many printed newspapers?</p> <p><b>Jake Adelstein:</b> In one sense it is being threatened because investigative journalism is rarely a solo project. It requires huge amounts of resources, capital, and time to really do one story correctly. Legal costs and FOIA documents are expensive things. The bigger the target, the greater the risk and the more money is required. The second-biggest threat to investigative journalism is crooked lawyers and corporate shills who sue as a harassment tactic. In general, it&#x2019;s rather hard and time-consuming to be an army of one. It took me almost three years to break the story about <i>yakuza</i> receiving liver transplants at UCLA on my own. The costs in financial terms were immense, and so were the losses along the way. A team of reporters could have done the work much faster, probably. </p> <p>However, these things said, blogging is also a great source of news that might go unreported, or be overlooked, by the mainstream media. Twitter, too, has had an interesting impact, actually helping a journalist get out of jail in the case of James Karl Buck. We&#x2019;re beginning to see kind of a public option in investigative journalism, too--such as things like ProPublica. They do an awesome job at investigative journalism, partly through donations, and they have a great web site. So the Internet is not all bad for investigative journalism, as long as we proceed with caution and forethought. At the same time, real intelligence-gathering work actually requires you to put down your cell phone and your computer and get off your ass and meet people in the real world. As odious as it may be, we have to sift through garbage, pound the pavement, and visit the scene of the crime. Not all answers can be found in front of a keyboard, or on Google, and the &#x201c;it&#x2019;s all in the database&#x201d; mentality is the bane of reporting and often generates shoddy reporting. </p> <p>The individual journalist can do great investigative work--it&#x2019;s just a lot harder, and usually financially difficult to do unless you&#x2019;re independently wealthy, like Bruce Wayne. Most of us don&#x2019;t have the time or the resources or the luxury of holding down a day job and doing investigative journalism on the side, as a hobby. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> What do you hope your American audience can learn from your book? </p> <p><b>Jake Adelstein:</b> I think everyone will take away something different from the book. I suppose you can learn a lot about how journalism works in Japan, how the police work, and how the <i>yakuza</i> work. I would also hope that people take away from the book an understanding of some of the things I really like about Japan and the Japanese, things like reciprocity, honor, loyalty, and stoic suffering. I think in Japan, I learned how important it is to keep your word, to never forget your debts--and not just the financial ones--and to make repayment in due course. Perhaps that&#x2019;s what honor is all about. </p> <p>There&#x2019;s a word in Japanese, <i>hanmen kyoshi</i>, which means, more or less, &#x201c;the teacher who teaches by his bad example.&#x201d; At times, I&#x2019;m an excellent <i>hanmen kyoshi</i> in the book. </p> <p>Everything I&#x2019;ve learned that&#x2019;s important to me is in the book somewhere. I hope there&#x2019;s something universal in the contents beyond just making people aware of cultural differences between the United States and Japan, or reiterating the importance and value of investigative journalism. Like a book I would choose to read to my children, I hope there&#x2019;s some kind of moral to it all. Maybe the real lesson is to be kind and helpful to the people you care about whenever you can, because it&#x2019;s good for them, and good for you, and your time with them may be much shorter than you imagined. </p> <p> (Photo � Michael Lionstar) </p><b>Jake Adelstein</b> was a reporter for the <i>Yomiuri Shinbun</i>, Japan&#x2019;s largest newspaper, from 1993 to 2005.

Young Willie Francis had been charged with the murder of a local pharmacist. The electric chair-three hundred pounds of oak and metal- had been dubbed Gruesome Gertie&#x201d; and was moved from one jailhouse to another throughout the state of Louisiana. The switch would be thrown at 12:08 P.M., but Willie Francis did not die. Miraculously, having survived this less than cordial encounter with death, Willie was soon informed that the state would try to kill him again in six days. Letters began pouring into St. Martinsville from across the country-Americans of all colors and classes were transfixed by the fate of this young man. A Cajun lawyer just returned from WWII, Bertrand DeBlanc would take on Willie's case-in the face of overwhelming local resistance. DeBlanc would argue the case all the way from the Bayou to the U.S. Supreme Court. In deciding Willie's fate the courts and the country would be forced to ask questions about capital punishment that remain unresolved today.</p><p><b>Gilbert King</b> is the author of <i>Woman, Child For Sale: The New Slave Trade in the 21st Century</i>, which was selected by the <i>Detroit Free Press</i> as one of its ten notable books of 2004.

As told in a sometimes repetitious avalanche of detail by King (<i>Woman, Child for Sale</i>), Francis's story is emblematic of the time and place&#x2014;a prominent white man in a Cajun town was gunned down, and soon Francis was picked up and, under duress and without an attorney, confessed to the crime. Despite no eyewitnesses and scant physical evidence, Francis was convicted and sentenced to death. After surviving the first execution attempt, he waited in prison nearly a year while the battle over his fate went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. After a page-turning start with the ill-fated execution attempt described in gripping detail, King runs out of steam. What's of interest is the horrifying botched execution and the fact, revealed late in the narrative, that Francis never denied committing the murder. While his eventual execution is tragic, this account doesn't add much to our understanding of U.S. race relations. 16 page b&amp;w insert not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But I discovered dreams in themselves, isolated, were not always interesting. Very few of them had the complete imagery and tension to arouse others&#x2019; interest. They were fragmented. The surrealists delighted in the image themselves. This was satisfying to the painters and to the film-makers. But to the novelist concerned with human character dramas, they seemed ephemeral and vaporous. They had to be connected with life. It was psychoanalysis which revealed to me the constant interaction of dream and action. It was a phrase of Jung&#x2019;s which inspired me to write <i>House of Incest</i>. He said: &#x201c;<i>Proceed from the dream outward.</i>&#x201d; In other words, it was essentially a matter of <i>precedence.</i> To capture the drama of the unconscious, one had to start with the key, and the key was the dream. But the novelist&#x2019;s task was to pursue this dream, to unravel its meaning; the goal was to reach the relation of dream to life; the suspense was in finding this which led to a deeper significance of our acts.<br><br> "Meanwhile a batch of dreams kept for a year served as a takeoff for <i>House of Incest</i>. They supplied the atmosphere, its climate and texture. At the same time I discovered that the dream had to be expanded, recreated, could not be told literally for then it became as flat and one-dimensional as representational realism. One had to find a language for it, a way of describing atmosphere, the colors and textures in which it moved. [...]&#x201d;<br><br> "The dream taught me not only the delight of sensory images, but the fact, far more vital, that they led directly into this realm of the unconscious which Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Proust attained in various ways&#x2015;Joyce by free association, with words, play on words, Proust by trusting the free associative process of memory and staying lingeringly in the realm between sleep and waking which resembles the waking dream, Virginia Woolf by accepting the vision of the poet as reality.<br><br><i>House of Incest</i> was, like a poem, visionary symbolic dream sequences which were woven together.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;Ana�s Nin, &#x201c;The Novel of the Future,&#x201d; (Athens: Ohio University Press, 1986), 118&#x2013;119<br><br> Originally published in 1936, <i>House of Incest</i> is Anais Nin's first work of fiction. The novel is a surrealistic look within the narrator's subconscious mind as she attempts to escape from a dream in which she is trapped, or in Nin's words, as she attempts to escape from "the woman's season in hell." In the documentary <i>Anais Observed</i>, Nin says House of Incest was based on dreams she'd had for more than a year.Nin's usage of the word incest in this case is metaphorical, not literal. In this book the word incest describes a selfish love where one can appreciate in another only that which is similar to oneself. One is then only loving oneself, shunning all differences. At first, such a self-love can seem ideal because it is without fear and without risk. But eventually it becomes a sterile nightmare.</p><p><p><b>Ana�s Nin</b> (1903-1977) is an iconic literary figure and one of the most notable experimental writers of the twentieth century. As one of the first women to explore female erotica, Nin revealed the inner desires of her characters in a way that made her works a touchstone for later feminist writers. Swallow Press is the premier US publisher of books by and about Nin.</p>&#x201c;House of Incest is a strange and challenging work that demands the full attention of the reader. It is not so much a story of people (although it certainly is that) as it is a visit into the hellish nightmare of the narrator's experience from which she emerges satisfactorily. But, however one approaches the work, House of Incest is Nin&#x2019;s best work of fiction and one that contains most of her basic themes, images and patterns that she would use in her later work."<br> &#x2015; Benjamin Franklin and Duane Schneider</p><h2>Terminal Freeze</h2><p>A breathtaking discovery at the top of the world . . .<br>A terrifying collision between modern science and Native American legend . . . <br>An electrifying new thriller from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Lincoln Child.<br>Two hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle lies Alaska� s Federal Wildlife Zone, one of the most remote and inhospitable places on Earth.

Lunch?"<br><br>Evan Marshall put the ziplock bag aside and stood up, massaging his lower back. He'd spent the last ninety minutes with his face inches above the ground, collecting samples from the glacial sediment, and it took his eyes a moment to adjust. The voice had been Sully's, and now Marshall made him out: a squat, slightly portly figure in a fur-lined parka, standing, arms crossed, thirty yards up the steep valley. Behind him rose the terminal tongue of the Fear glacier, a rich, mysterious blue riddled with white fracture lines. Large ice boulders lay scattered along its base like so many monstrous diamonds, along with daggerlike shards of ancient lava. Marshall opened his mouth to warn Sully against standing so close: the glacier was as dangerous as it was pretty, since the weather had turned warmer and the ice front was calving off deadly chunks at an unprecedented rate. Then he thought better of it. Gerard Sully was proud of his position as nominal leader and didn't like being told what to do. Instead, Marshall just shook his head. "I think I'll pass, thanks."<br><br>"Suit yourself." Sully turned toward Wright Faraday, the party's evolutionary biologist, who was busying himself a little downslope. "How's about it, Wright?"<br><br>Faraday glanced up, watery blue eyes oddly magnified behind tortoiseshell frames. A digital camera dangled from a heavy strap around his neck. "Not me," he said with a frown, as if the thought of stopping to eat in the middle of a workday was somehow heretical.<br><br>"Starve yourselves if you want to. Just don't ask me to bring anything back."<br><br>"Not even a Popsicle?" asked Marshall.<br><br>Sully smiled thinly. He was about as short as Napoleon, and radiated a combination of egotism and insecurity that Marshall found especially annoying. He'd been able to put up with it back at the university, where Sully was just one arrogant scientist among many, but up here on the ice--with nowhere to escape--it had grown irksome. Perhaps, he reflected, he should be relieved that their expedition had only a few weeks to play out.<br><br>"You look tired," Sully said. "Out walking again last night?"<br><br>Marshall nodded.<br><br>"You'd better be careful. You might fall into a lava tube and freeze to death."<br><br>"All right, Mom. I'll be careful."<br><br>"Or run into a polar bear, or something."<br><br>"That's all right. I'm starved for some good conversation."<br><br>"It's no joke, you refusing to carry a gun and all."<br><br>Marshall didn't like the direction this was leading. "Look, if you run into Ang, tell him I've got more samples here for transport back to the lab."<br><br>"I'll do that. He'll be thrilled."<br><br>Marshall watched the climatologist make his way carefully past them, down the rubble toward the foot of the mountain and their base. He called it "their base," but of course it belonged to the U.S. government: officially known as the Mount Fear Remote Sensing Installation and decommissioned almost fifty years ago, it consisted of a low, gray, sprawling, _institutional-looking structure, festooned with radar domes and other detritus of the cold war. Beyond it lay a frigid landscape of permafrost and lava deposits spewed ages ago from the mountain's guts, gullied and split as if the earth had torn itself apart in geologic agony. In many places, the surface was hidden beneath large snowfields. There were no roads, no other structures, no living things. It was as hostile, as remote, as alien as the moon.<br><br>He stretched as he looked out over the forbidding landscape. Even after four weeks on-site, it still seemed hard to believe that anyplace could be so barren. But then the entire scientific expedition had seemed a little unreal from the start. Unreal that a media giant like Terra Prime had picked their grant applications for approval: four scientists from Northern Massachusetts University with nothing in common save an interest in global warming. Unreal that the government had given them clearance to use Fear Base, _admittedly at significant expense and with strict limitations. And unreal that the warming trend itself was occurring with such breathtaking, frightening speed.<br><br>He turned away with a sigh. His knees hurt from hours of crouching over the terminal moraine, collecting samples. His fingertips and nose were half frozen. And to add insult to injury, the snow had turned to thin freezing sleet that was now slowly seeping through three layers of clothing and settling into the most intimate crevices of his person. But daylight was brief these days, and their expedition's window was fast closing. He was keenly aware of how little time he had left. There would be plenty of food back in Woburn, Massachusetts, and plenty of time to eat it.<br><br>As he turned to retrieve the sample bags, he heard Faraday speak again. "Five years ago, even two, I'd never believe it. Rain."<br><br>"It's not rain, Wright. It's sleet."<br><br>"Close enough. Rain in the Zone, with winter coming on? Unbelievable."<br><br>The "Zone" was a vast stretch of northeastern Alaska, hard against the Arctic Ocean, sandwiched between the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on one side and the Yukon's Ivvavik National Park on the other. It was a tract so cold and desolate that nobody wanted anything to do with it: temperatures struggled to get above zero only a few months out of the year. Years ago, the government branded it the Federal Wilderness Zone and promptly forgot all about it. There were, Marshall reflected, probably no more than two dozen people in all its two million acres: their own scientific team of five, the base's skeleton crew of four, a small band of Native Americans to the north, and a scattering of backpackers and loners who were too hard-core or eccentric to settle for anything but the most remote. How strange to think there were few people farther north on the planet than their little group.<br><br>A sudden, tremendous report, like the crack of a cannon, shook the glacial valley with the violence of an earthquake. The sound echoed across the tundra below them, violating the profound silence, bouncing back and forth like a tennis ball, growing slowly fainter as it receded into endless distance. Above, the face of the glacier had shorn away, tons of ice and snow adding to the frozen rubble lying along its forward edge. Marshall felt his heart lurch uncomfortably in his chest. No matter how many times he heard that sound, its violence always came as a shock.<br><br>Faraday pointed toward it. "See? That's exactly what I mean. A valley glacier like the Fear should taper to a nice, thin ice front, with a minimum of meltwater and a healthy percolation zone. But this one is calving like a tidewater glacier. I've been measuring the basal melt--"<br><br>"That's Sully's job, not yours."<br><br>"--and it's off the scale." Faraday shook his head. "Rain, unprecedented melting--and there are other things happening, too. Like the northern lights the last few nights. You notice them?"<br><br>"Of course. A single color--it was spectacular. And unusual."<br><br>"Unusual." Faraday repeated the word thoughtfully.<br><br>Marshall did not reply. In his experience, every scientific expedition, even one as small as this, had its Cassandra figure. Wright Faraday--with his prodigious learning, his pessimistic outlook on life, his dark theories and outrageous predictions--played the role expertly. Marshall gave the biologist a covert glance. Despite knowing him casually as a university colleague, and now having spent a month almost continually in his presence, he didn't really have a good idea what made the man tick.<br><br>Still--Marshall thought as he filled and sealed a fresh bag, recorded the sample's location in a notebook, then measured and photographed the extraction site--Faraday had a point. And that point was one reason he himself was collecting samples at an almost frantic pace. A glacier was a near-perfect place for his kind of research. During its formation, as it accumulated snow, it trapped organic remains: pollen, plant fibers, animal remains. Later, as the glacier retreated, melting slowly away, it gracefully yielded up those secrets once again. This was an ideal gift for a paleoecologist, a treasure trove from the past.<br><br>Except there was nothing slow or graceful about this glacier's retreat. It was falling to pieces with alarming speed--and taking its secrets with it.<br><br>As if on cue, there was another ear-shattering explosion from the face of the glacier, another shuddering cascade of ice. Marshall glanced toward the sound, feeling a mixture of irritation and impatience. A much larger section of the glacier's face had fallen away this time. With a sigh, he bent toward his specimens, then abruptly swiveled back in the direction of the glacier. Among the fractured ice boulders at its base, he could see that part of the mountain face beneath had been exposed by the calving. He squinted at it for a moment. Then he called over to Faraday.<br><br>"You've got the field glasses, don't you?"<br><br>"Right here."<br><br>Marshall walked toward him. The biologist had pulled the binoculars from a pocket and was holding them out with a heavily gloved hand. Marshall took them, breathed on the eyepieces to warm them, wiped them free of mist, then raised them toward the glacier.<br><br>"What is it?" Faraday said, excitement kindling in his voice. "What do you see?"<br><br>Marshall licked his lips and stared at what the fallen ice had revealed. "It's a cave," he replied.<br>2<br><br>An hour later, they stood before the icy rubble at the Fear glacier's front face. The freezing rain had stopped, and a weak sun struggled to pierce the gunmetal clouds. Marshall rubbed his arms briskly, trying to warm himself. He looked around at their little group. Sully had returned, bringing with him Ang Chen, the team's graduate student. Except for Penny Barbour, their computer scientist, the entire expedition was now assembled at the terminal moraine.<br><br>The cave lay directly ahead, its mouth black against the clear blue of the glacial ice. To Marshall, it looked like the barrel of a monstrous gun.

He shows that these cultures possessed great knowledge, much of which they claimed was given them by visitors from Sirius. There are tribal cultures in present-day Africa (notably the Dogon of Mali) whose most sacred traditions are based on this theory; their knowledge of the Sirius system is astounding in its accuracy and detail, including information only recently known to modern science. <p> Many authors have speculated on the subject of extraterrestrial contact, but never before has such a detailed theory been formulated. <b>The Sirius Mystery</b> provides facts gathered during eight years of research.</p></p><p>A fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Temple earned a degree in Oriental studies and Sanskrit at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Beginning in broken English, Nannie tells of her incredibly difficult first year at the school, including entries detailing her previous life as her ability to communicate in English grows. From December, 1879, to October, 1880, readers follow a remarkably resilient girl, uprooted from her home and culture, trying to find a place for herself in a rapidly changing world. Loyal, caring, and creative, she is able to see a spirit helper in a kitchen mouse and willing to defy regulations in mourning the death of her dearest friend. Rinaldi depicts widely divergent cultures with clarity and compassion. Captain Pratt, founder of a school that forcibly strips children of their native culture, also provides vocational training and field trips, and responds to his students as true individuals. The body of the text is followed by an epilogue telling of Nannie's later life, an extensive historical note, and black-and-white photos. The period, the setting, and Nannie herself all come to life. An excellent addition to a popular series.<br><i>Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Beginning with slow, laboring words that lead first to ghastly realization, and then to mature understanding, Rinaldi (Cast Two Shadows, 1998, etc.) explores some of the tragic fates of Native American children during the late 1800s. This entry in the Dear America series explains how thousands of such children were sent away from their families and people to schools intended to purge them of traditional ways. As a student in Pennsylvania's Carlisle Indian School, Nannie, 12, struggles to cope with the mysterious ``white'' people. She protects her vulnerable best friend, Pretty Eagle, who often goes into spiritual trances. When the whites mistake Pretty Eagle's trance state for death, and bury her alive, Nannie knows she could have prevented the tragedy, and finds this knowledge all but unbearable. This is a strong addition to Rinaldi's ongoing historical explorations; it builds slowly to a terrifying climax that will linger long in readers' emotions, and offers genuine insight into the courage, weaknesses, and essential humanity of Native American children who made the painful transition from old ways to new ones.

A man with penetrating insight into post-Christian, post-modern life, Schaeffer also cared deeply about people and their search for truth, meaning, and beauty. If there is one central theme throughout Schaeffer&#39;s work, it is that &#34;true truth&#34; is revealed in the Bible by &#34;the God who is there,&#34; and that what we do with this truth has decisive consequences in every area of life. Death in the City was Schaeffer&#39;s third book and is foundational to his thinking. Written against the backdrop of the sixties countercultural upheaval, it reads today with the same ring of truth regarding personal, moral, spiritual, and intellectual concerns. Especially in light of 9/11, Schaeffer seems disturbingly prophetic. The death that Schaeffer writes about is more than just physical death--it is the moral and spiritual death that subtly suffocates truth and meaning and beauty out of the city and the wider culture. What is the answer that Schaeffer offers in response? It is commitment to God&#39;s Word as truth--a costly practice in the midst of the intellectual, moral, and philosophical battles of our day. It is compassion for a world that is lost and dying without the Gospel. It is yielding our lives to God and allowing Him to bring forth His fruit through us. Few have demonstrated this commitment to truth and &#34;persistence of compassion&#34; so consistently as Schaeffer did. And because of this, few who begin reading these pages will come to the end without having their life profoundly changed.</p><p></p><h2>WORDS THEIR WAY LEVEL C STUDENT NOTEBOOK 2005C</h2><p><p>Keep students engaged and reduce your prep time with these colorful 160-page consumable notebooks.

"O&#x2019;Hara the quintessential Postmodernist . . . His work is a kind of watershed, a culmination of the Modernists&#x2019; efforts to exploit the city, and a prototype of the poetry to come."&#x2014;Neal Bowers</p></p><p>Frank O'Hara, the son of Russell Joseph O'Hara and Katherine (n�e Broderick) was born on March 27, 1926, at Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore and grew up in Grafton, Massachusetts. He attended St. John's High School in Worcester. He grew up believing he had been born in June, but in fact had been born in March, his parents having disguised his true date of birth because he was conceived out of wedlock. He studied piano at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1941 to 1944 and served in the South Pacific and Japan as a sonarman on the destroyer USS Nicholas during World War II.<br><br>With the funding made available to veterans he attended Harvard University, where artist and writer Edward Gorey was his roommate. Although O'Hara majored in music and did some composing, his attendance was irregular and his interests disparate. He regularly attended classes in philosophy and theology, while writing impulsively in his spare time. O'Hara was heavily influenced by visual art and by contemporary music, which was his first love (he remained a fine piano player all his life and would often shock new partners by suddenly playing swathes of Rachmaninoff when visiting them). His favorite poets were Arthur Rimbaud, St�phane Mallarm�, Boris Pasternak, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. While at Harvard, O'Hara met John Ashbery and began publishing poems in the Harvard Advocate. Despite his love of music, O'Hara changed his major and graduated from Harvard in 1950 with a degree in English.<br><br>He then attended graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. While at Michigan, he won a Hopwood Award and received his M.A. in English literature in 1951. That autumn O'Hara moved into an apartment in New York City with Joe LeSueur, who would be his roommate and sometime lover for the next 11 years. It was in New York that he began teaching at The New School.<br><br>Known throughout his life for his extreme sociability, passion, and warmth, O'Hara had hundreds of friends and lovers throughout his life, many from the New York art and poetry worlds. Soon after arriving in New York, he was employed at the front desk of the Museum of Modern Art and began to write seriously.<br><br>O'Hara was active in the art world, working as a reviewer for Artnews, and in 1960 was Assistant Curator of Painting and Sculpture Exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art. He was also friends with the artists Willem de Kooning, Norman Bluhm, Larry Rivers and Joan Mitchell.<br><br>In the early morning hours of July 24, 1966, O'Hara was struck by a dune buggy on the Fire Island beach. He died the next day of a ruptured liver. O'Hara was buried in Green River Cemetery on Long Island. The painter Larry Rivers, a longtime friend and lover of O'Hara's, delivered the eulogy.<br>"Companion to an earlier volume, <em>Early Writings</em> (1977), and the original <em>Collected Poems</em> (1971), this is a portion of an anticipated complete collected poems of O'Hara.

Drawing on his own experiences and offering a portrait of the people and animals who take part in hunting, Scruton introduces the reader to some of the mysteries of country life.</p><p>Roger Scruton lives in Wiltshire where he hunts with the Beaufort and Vale of White Horse. He is the author of over twenty books and is a well-known media personality. A knight-errant on behalf of forgotten truth, he has espoused every cause deemed lost by mad modernity."My life divides into three parts," philosopher-journalist Scruton says. "In the first I was wretched; in the second ill at ease; in the third hunting." He wasn't born to the hunt. His parents were industrial Midlanders, and his ardent Labourite father, despairing of his son's class loyalties when his scion was admitted to a grammar school with public school pretensions, was partly mollified only when Roger "skived off sports, . . . opt[ed] out of cadets, and was generally . . . unhappy and insolent." He discovered hunting accidentally, when out riding a generally docile horse owned by a colleague. A foxhunt passed by and, after standing a while mesmerized by it, the old steed took off to join it and proved to be "a 'front-runner,' a horse determined to be first in the herd." Scruton was hooked and has been hunting ever since for a complex of reasons he lays out, explains, and proselytizes in this thoroughly delightful essay that is not without its depths of patriotic feeling, interspecies fellowship, small-c conservative sentiment--and bone-wrenching unsaddlings. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet <i>Pale Fire</i> is more outrageously hilarious, and its narrative convolutions make the earlier book seem as straightforward as a fairy tale. Here's the plot--listen carefully! John Shade is a homebody poet in New Wye, U.S.A. He writes a 999-line poem about his life, and what may lie beyond death. This novel (and seldom has the word seemed so woefully inadequate) consists of both that poem and an extensive commentary on it by the poet's crazy neighbor, Charles Kinbote.<p> According to this deranged annotator, he had urged Shade to write about his own homeland--the northern kingdom of Zembla. It soon becomes clear that this fabulous locale may well be a figment of Kinbote's colorfully cracked, prismatic imagination. Meanwhile, he manages to twist the poem into an account of Zembla's King Charles--whom he believes himself to <i>be</i>--and the monarch's eventual assassination by the revolutionary Jakob Gradus.</p><p> In the course of this dizzying narrative, shots are indeed fired. But it's Shade who takes the hit, enabling Kinbote to steal the dead poet's manuscript and set about annotating it. Is that perfectly clear? By now it should be obvious that <i>Pale Fire</i> is not only a whodunit but a who-wrote-it. There isn't, of course, a single solution. But Nabokov's best biographer, Brian Boyd, has come up with an ingenious suggestion: he argues that Shade is actually guiding Kinbote's mad hand from beyond the grave, nudging him into completing what he'd intended to be a 1,000-line poem. Read this magical, melancholic mystery and see if you agree. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>In Pale Fire Nabokov offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures: a 999-line poem by the reclusive genius John Shade; an adoring foreword and commentary by Shade&#39;s self-styled Boswell, Dr. Charles Kinbote; a darkly comic novel of suspense, literary idolatry and one-upmanship, and political intrigue.</p><h2>The New McDougall Cookbook</h2><p>A collection of three hundred meatless, dairyless, and fat-free recipes, offering balanced blends of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains, uses the latest research of the McDougalls, proving that health does not have to be boring. Tour.</p><p><b>John McDougall, M.D</b>., is the author of many previous books, including <b>The McDougall Program, The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss</b>, and <b>The New McDougall Cookbook</b>. His latest title is <b>The Healthiest Diet on the Planet: Why the Foods You Love-Pizza, Pancakes, Potatoes, Pasta, and More-Are the Solution to Preventing Disease and Looking and Feeling Your Best.</b> He is the founder and director of the McDougall Program at St. Helena Hospital in Napa Valley, California, and has a nationally syndicated television show as well as a weekly radio program. He lives in Santa Rosa, California.The McDougall diet is unlike most medically based diet plans in that it doesn't limit the amount eaten, but radically changes what is eaten and how it is prepared. These recipes eliminate fats, meats and dairy products. The McDougalls ( The McDougall Program ) run an in-patient program at St. Helena Hospital in Santa Rosa, Calif., for people who want to drastically change their eating habits. The recipes substitute water for cooking oil and soy-based products for dairy ingredients. The McDougalls write that their diet plan is less extreme than the Kempner Diet developed at Duke University Medical School, and that it would seem to be a good choice for athletes or people who must change their eating habits either because of health problems or severe food allergies. For the rest of the eating public, however, the McDougalls's claims are bound to raise eyebrows; to wit, "The incidence of human leukemia worldwide is in direct proportion to the amount of dairy products consumed," and "I realized early in my career that the diseases from which most people suffer are caused by eating too much rich food." To their credit, the McDougalls do offer a wide range of recipes drawn from many different ethnic backgrounds--e.g., black bean burritos and waffles. They also discuss how to adapt a recipe to their regimen. Their recipes are well-organized, and a list of health food mail-order stores is provided. Given the draconian nature of the McDougall diet, however, it's not something to start without careful consideration. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>ESV Following Jesus Bible</h2><p><p>The&nbsp;<em>ESV Following Jesus Bible</em>&nbsp;is full of content designed to help children understand and enjoy the Bible.

Why don&#39;t you have a proper mummy and daddy like everybody else?&#34; Suddenly I knew that the question had been there a long time, buried deep and never asked, and that there was no answer.</p><p><b>PATRICIA ST. JOHN</b> (1919-1993) was a nurse, missionary and author. She earned a nursing degree at St. Thomas� Hospital in London in 1946. In the early 1950�s she moved to Tangier, Morocco where she served as a missionary nurse for 27 years. Throughout her life, she travelled extensively in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, as the settings of her novels reflect. In 1977, she returned to England, where she cared for elderly relatives and ministered from her home to youths, single parents, and the elderly.

In her latest book, Anne shares her heart and God's teachings on the universal problem of suffering.</p> <p>Drawing her characteristically keen insights from the familiar story of Lazarus in the ninth and eleventh chapters of the Gospel of John, Anne offers Jesus' reassuring answers to our heartfelt cries for understanding: </p> <ul> <li>Why doesn't God care?</li> <li>Why does He let these things happen?</li> <li>Why me?</li> <li>Why doesn't God answer my prayers?</li> <li>Why didn't He protect me?</li> <li>Why doesn't He perform a miracle?</li></ul> <p>Why? helps us understand and deal with suffering while guiding us to the ultimate answer--the Savior who shares our grief and our tears.<br></p> <p></p></p><p>ANNE GRAHAM LOTZ, daughter of Billy and Ruth Graham, is the President and Executive Director of AnGeL Ministries, a non-profit organization offering Christian outreach. Anne has spoken on all seven continents in more than twenty foreign countries, proclaiming the word of God at seminaries, colleges, conferences and revivals. Anne and her husband, Daniel, reside in Raleigh, North Carolina.The veteran preacher and daughter of Billy Graham has a richly deserved reputation as a charismatic interpreter of God's word. In this tenacious audio, she recounts a series of tragedies with compassion and worldly authority, all the while referring to her Bible like someone who knows the truths in her heart, rather than just on the sacred pages. Her reading is clear and compelling, though slightly confined by the recording studio, in contrast to how one imagines she would sound in front of a crowd. Moving us beyond the question of why God allows suffering, she takes listeners to a higher realm where she lifts up the defeated and inspires a sense of community in those who feel abandoned.

I finished this book in one night. If I could, I'd see the tour, and buy the t-shirt' - B&amp;N Sci-fi and Fantasy Blog 'Could very well be the debut of the year' - Fantasy Book Review Clay Cooper and his band were once the best of the best - the meanest, dirtiest, most feared and admired crew of mercenaries this side of the Heartwyld. But their glory days are long past; the mercs have grown apart and grown old, fat, drunk - or a combination of the three. Then a former bandmate turns up at Clay's door with a plea for help: his daughter Rose is trapped in a city besieged by an enemy horde one hundred thousand strong and hungry for blood. Rescuing Rose is the kind of impossible mission that only the very brave or the very stupid would sign up for. It's time to get the band back together for one last tour across the Wyld. LOOK OUT FOR BLOODY ROSE, THE SECOND BOOK IN THE BAND SERIES: 'Bloody Rose solidifies what Kings of the Wyld proved. Eames writes like a hurricane and has a voice like no one else in this genre' - Sam Sykes</p><p>Nicholas Eames was born to parents of infinite patience and unstinting support in Wingham, Ontario. Though he attended college for theatre arts, he gave up acting to pursue the infinitely more attainable profession of &#39;epic fantasy novelist&#39;. Kings of the Wyld is his first novel. Nicholas loves black coffee, neat whiskey, the month of October and video games. He currently lives in Ontario, Canada, and is probably writing at this very moment.An absolutely outstanding debut . . . [It has] all the heart and passion that great fantasy can bring in the hands of a master -- Myke Cole, author of THE ARMOURED SAINT George R. R. Martin meets Terry Pratchett -- BUZZFEED BOOKS A cheeky, warm-hearted romp through a D+D monster compendium with a memorable (mostly pensionable) band of mercenaries being pinballed from one crisis to another. Nick delivers a sharp, funny and satisfying page-turner -- Adrian Selby, author of SNAKEWOOD The best debut I have read in awhile, Nicholas Eames' Kings of the Wyld has everything I love in the fantasy genre with some original twists and angles -- THE QUILL TO LIVE Eames cranked it all the way to 11. So f*** it, you know what? 11 out of 10. As the saying goes: They don't make 'em like they used to. But Eames did. And he made it better -- Michael Everest Fantastic, funny, ferocious. Hugely recommended. Read it now -- Sam Sykes This book kicks ass! It's downright funny, adventurous, exciting, touching, heart wrenching, and engaging! . . . Give Kings Of The Wyld a try, just be prepared to set aside all your other books for it! This reader can't wait for more from the author -- RED STAR REVIEWS From a trek across dangerous lands to a massive final battle intermingled with unyielding humor, this felt like GRRM plowing into Terry Practhett at a ridiculously fast pace. Nonstop entertainment in a rare and beautiful form, this book will tackle and capture the heart of fantasy and adventure lovers alike. Be prepared to traverse the Heartwyld with the most rambunctious collection of characters known to man and find yourself loving every minute of it -- BOOKS, VERTIGO AND TEA Eames' debut was one of the most fun times I've had in a long while, and I honestly cannot wait to see what he's going to write next -- SPECULATIVE HERALD We grow to care so much about these men who once fought for glory, but now do so for each other, and for what is right. There were moments where I cheered, moments where I laughed, or held my baited breath as the book took that roller coaster-like lurch over the hill into a giant set piece battle or brawl. I love these characters, their camaraderie, their sense of duty, their love for one another. I love that I haven't had this much fun reading in a long, long time. . . .You will want this debut. Very. Very. Much. Long live the Kings of the Wyld -- SERIAL BOOKSELLER It's superbly written, full of action, has a really solid plot line that never lets up, some of the most awesome characters I've ever read, and a really well built world full of all kinds of mythological and legendary creatures . . .

Eames is an author that has the potential to set gene trends with this book -- BOOKWORM BLUES An entertaining, brilliantly crafted adventure . . . You'll fall in love with the members of Saga and want to cheer them on every step of the way . . .

Wyld also works hard to make its characters meaningful - you're not just along for the craaaaazy ride, you actually care about the other passengers -- PORNOKITSCH This will be one of THE books of 2017. Brilliant, innovative, immersive and just pure fun to read. -- THE BOOK PLANK Kings of the Wyld is rollicking, explosive fun from cover to cover . . . written with exuberance and elan. Always assured, Eames strikes the same balance as Pratchett at his best, drawing humour from the conventions and tropes of high fantasy while also clearly loving them -- BLUE BOOK BALLOON Kings of the Wyld does everything right . . . Nicholas Eames knows how to write and, more importantly, he knows how to pace and structure a novel. He mixes action and humor in equal measure, and weaves genuine emotion into the heroics. It's a fun novel, but one where sorrow and melancholy are always lurking just under the narrative . . . I loved the characters, loved the journey and even loved the climax . . . Kings of the Wyld is a fantastically fun read, from beginning to end, and I am already looking forward to the sequel. -- BEAUTY IN RUINS I only have two questions that remain unanswered - (1) Where do I get my Saga tour t-shirt?

This is, without a shadow of a doubt, unmissable -- TINY REVIEWS I had a brilliant time reading this book. Kings of the Wyld is escapism of my favourite type - noble quests, edge of the seat action and well-rounded, likeable characters that carve out their own unique definition of "family" -- FORBIDDEN PLANET Nicholas Eames brings brazen fun and a rock &amp; roll sensibility to the fantasy genre -- Sebastien de Castell, author of TRAITOR'S BLADE Kings of the Wyld took me back to my Dungeons and Dragons days. It has well-crafted characters long past their best but still fighting, non-stop fantasy action and welcome touches of humour. Great reading! -- Ian Irvine A promising, fast-paced debut that balances classic quest fantasy with modern sensibilities and liberal doses of humor. Huzzah! -- Alex Marshall, author of A CROWN FOR COLD SILVER It was a fantastic read, a rollicking, page-turning, edge-of-your-seat road-trip of a book. Great characters, loveable rogues that I genuinely cared about and all manner of fantastical monsters. All spiced with a sly sense of humour that had me smiling throughout. Wonderful -- John Gwynne, author of MALICE Absolutely awesome. If the Beatles held a concert tomorrow (with all the necromancy required for that to happen), it still wouldn't be as good a 'getting the band back together' story as this. Full of heroes, humor, and heart. -- Jon Hollins, author of DRAGON LORDS: FOOL'S GOLD An outstanding debut which will make you laugh and cry and hold your breath. This is a book that has it all -- K. J. Parker Manages to be a comedy, an adventure tale, a consideration on growing older, and a sendup of fantasy conventions, all at the same time. It also has heart. In short: it rocks . . . I finished this book in one night. If I could, I'd see the tour, and buy the t-shirt. Instead, I'll have to content myself with waiting for the sequel, and reading it again -- B&amp;N SCI-FI AND FANTASY BLOG Brilliant debut novel . . .

Unsystematic, spontaneous, irreverent, intense, witty, unexpected, these notebooks shimmer with reflections, speculations, confessions, quotations, impressions, and ruminations. They create a portrait of the artist as a purposeful gatherer and sifter of every kind of experience.<br><br> Included are the notebooks from such distinguished and eclectic voices as Rita Dove, Stephen Dunn, Carolyn Forch�, Donald Hall, Garrett Hongo, Joy Harjo, Donald Justice, Yusef Komunyakaa, James Merrill, Mary Oliver, Charles Simic, and William Stafford.</p><p>In <i>The Poet's Notebook</i> readers are privy to memories, dreams, reflections, poems, and overheard conversations as recorded in the notebooks of 26 contemporary American poets who subscribe to Somerset Maugham's belief that "the mere habit of notebook keeping might make the writer more observant." Donald Hall compares writing (favorably, it lasts longer) to orgasm. William Matthews ponders a Dylan bootleg, envying the musician his ability "to turn one's work inside out, mock it, vamp it, make it both new and continuous with its former versions" (a published poem is, well, published). Liz Rosenberg likens a poem to a baby, because both are "self-absorbed and containing ... the universal breath, and needing constant tiny cares and adjustments." And Lisel Mueller invokes Yehuda Amichai's demand that "every poem should be the last poem, written as if it contained the last thing the poet would ever say, shaped to contain a condensation of all the messages of his or her life." Whew.

From seed-gathering to planting, harvesting, and eating home-grown fruits and vegetables, children join Little Groundhog in learning about the gardening process. At the end, Little Groundhog invites his animal friends to a Thanksgiving harvest feast.<br> Beautiful illustrations and thorough research on plants and insects make this sweet story an engrossing read, as well as a great picture-book introduction to how plants grow. Children and schools can follow Groundhog's lessons.</p><p>Lynne Cherry is the author and/or illustrator of over 30 award-winning books for children. Her best-selling books such as The Great Kapok Tree, A River Ran Wild and The Armadillo From Amarillo teach children a respect for the earth. She lectures widely &#x2014; and passionately &#x2014; about how children can make a difference in a democratic society &#x2014; if they feel strongly about something, they can change the world. She explains to educators how using nature to integrate curriculum makes a child's learning relevant. Lynne's books were inspired by her love of the natural world. She is also an avid canoeist and hiker.<br><br>Lynne is also an environmental activist whose books are used to launch campaigns to save land, clean up rivers, save forests, and help migratory birds. For example, her book A River Ran Wild is in most fourth-grade classroom reading anthologies and is used by teachers to launch projects to study local watersheds and to clean them up. Her book Flute's Journey: The Life of a Wood Thrush focused national media attention on conservation efforts to save the Belt Woods in Maryland when she was featured on CBS News Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood.<br><br>Lynne earned her B.A. at Tyler School of Art and her M.A. in History at Yale University. She has been artist-in-residence at the Smithsonian, the Geosciences department at both the University of Massachusetts and Cornell University, at the Marine Biological Lab, and at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and at the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University.<br>An entertaining, creative story that's loaded with information. When hungry Little Groundhog tries to eat some vegetables out of Squirrel's garden, kind Squirrel takes him under his proverbial wing and shows him how to plant his own veggies to share with the entire animal community. Cherry intertwines the facts and vocabulary of gardening into a believable plot that will keep children reading, and her illustrations are well planned to combine with the text in an unusual way. Expansive spreads showing the animals tending their plots alternate with smaller, framed art. These smaller pictures are surrounded by clearly labeled pictures of various plants at different stages and other related objects. The detailed art continues on the endpapers, where readers can trace the growing cycle of many vegetables. This charming story teaches children about the interplay among all living things, and the good feeling that comes with community participation and sharing.--School Library Journal, February 2003<br><br>Little Groundhog loves eating from the neighbor's vegetable garden--maybe too much. Perhaps it's time he planted his own garden and, fortunately, Squirrel is willing to show him how. The two animals collect seeds, store them, and after winter hibernation and spring thaw, plant and tend them. By summer, Little Groundhog is joyfully harvesting and eating what they sowed. And such a plentiful harvest calls for sharing, bringing a wonderful Thanksgiving feast for all to enjoy. In simple, descriptive language, Cherry, author of The Great Kapok Tree (1990), tells a charming and also informative story about plants, gardening, and environmental respect. Her beautiful, full-color illustrations--realistic and wonderfully detailed--often incorporate spot-art borders of labeled seedlings and plants, highlighting a diverse array of wildlife. In an author's note, Cherry describes her own gardening experiences and suggests a few resources for information. Little Groundhog is an endearing character whose awe in the miracle of growth is irresistible; by the close of the story, he has learned the rewards and joy of gardening, as well as the pleasures of friendship and giving. --Booklist, February 1, 2003<br>Fact and fiction make fruitful partners in Cherry's (The Great Kapok Tree) cheerful account of a young groundhog's successful efforts to plant a vegetable garden. After Squirrel scolds Little Groundhog for feasting on the bounty of others' gardens, the fellow apologizes and admits he doesn't know how to plant his own. Squirrel willingly becomes his mentor, sharing her ample horticultural knowledge as she offers a chatty guide to planning, planting, tending, transplanting and harvesting a garden. Cherry's detailed, impressively precise renderings of the garden's offerings (traced from seeds, through seedlings to final product) and of the woodland animals who lend a gardening hand should easily snare the attention of aspiring green-thumbers; marginalia appear as detailed as scientific notebook sketches, artfully arranged in borders around the main action. The author interjects environmental messages, as when Wren and Praying Mantis strike a deal with Little Groundhog: "If you promise not to harm us with bug spray, we birds and insects will help you with your garden. We will eat the harmful insects that hurt your plants." Youngsters may well find this fledgling gardener's exuberance infectious ("It's beautiful! Scrumptious! Irresistible!" he exclaims as he prepares to share his homegrown food with his friends). If not tempted to grab a hoe, readers are at least likely to view the vegetables on their dinner plates with greater appreciation.--Publishers Weekly, December 16, 2002<br><br>Good intentions crash and burn when the ill winds of pedantry overwhelm this story of a garden's year. Here is Little Groundhog doing what groundhogs were born to do: seek and destroy gardens. Along comes Squirrel, loo</p><h2>The Little Gardener</h2><p>Celebrate the tender story The Little Gardener with a beautiful new cover in the updated 2018 edition!<br><br>There was once a little gardener and his garden meant everything to him.

Finding<br>inspiration and value in 18th-century plants, tools, and techniques, the gardeners at Colonial Williamsburg have discovered that these traditional vegetable-growing methods are perfectly at home in today's modern organic gardens. After all, in the 18th century, organic gardening was the <i>only</i> type of gardening and local produce the only produce available.<br>Author Wesley Greene founded the Colonial Garden in Colonial Williamsburg's Historic Area in 1996. He and his colleagues have painstakingly researched the ways the colonists planted and tended their vegetable and herb beds, most of which are more relevant than ever. Along with historical commentary and complete growing instructions for 50 delicious vegetables, including colonial varieties still available today, gardeners and folklorists will find weather-watching guidelines, planting techniques, and seedsaving advice for legumes, brassicas, alliums, root crops, nightshades, melons, squash, greens, and other curious and tender produce.</p><p><b>Wesley Greene</b> is the garden historian at Colonial Williamsburg, the 301-acre historic area that includes famed gardens and hundreds of historically furnished buildings. More than 100 million visitors have toured Colonial Williamsburg since 1932.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Of Beans and Peas<br><br>The vegetables we know as beans and peas, called legumes, are members of the large Fabaceae family and represent some of the most important vegetable staples known to humankind. They were also among the first vegetables to be domesticated and helped to lay the foundation for three of the world's great centers of civilization. Mesopotamia was blessed with a luxury of legumes that included the field pea, chickpea, lentil, and broad bean. Of this group, the pea and the broad bean migrated west and north to become staples in medieval Europe. English colonists brought them to Virginia in the first decade of settlement. The New World kidney bean was domesticated in Peru about 8000 BCE, and its culture spread north, reaching today's southeastern United States by 5000 BCE. It became the most common New World vegetable on European tables. The soybean was a relative latecomer, first domesticated in China a little more than 3,000 years ago. It made its first tentative appearance in North America in the 18th century but was not adopted as a field crop until early in the 20th century, so it was of no consequence in colonial American gardens.<br><br>Legumes are rich protein sources, which made them the perfect companion crop for the world's three major grains: wheat from Mesopotamia, corn from Mesoamerica, and rice from ancient China. It was this dietary combination of legumes and grains that allowed these cultures to flourish.<br><br>Garden legumes are notable for "fixing" nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with soil-borne bacteria, called rhizobia, which live in nodules formed on the plants' roots. This relationship enables peas and beans to thrive without extra nitrogen fertilizers and helps to enrich the soil for crops that follow, making legumes near-perfect nutritional and organic garden elements.<br><br>BROAD BEAN<br><br>Vicia faba<br><br>Pliny the Elder, Roman chronicler of the ancient world, recorded that the Greek mathematician Pythagoras forbade his students to eat broad beans. Pythagoras's reason for this ban on beans has been debated for more than a thousand years. One reason Pliny offered was the belief that departed souls resided within the beans. Thomas Hale, writing in 1756, had a different interpretation: "What he [Pythagoras] meant by this was, that they should abstain from meddling with the Affairs of the Republick; because the Antients used Beans in the electing of their Magistrates." In ancient times, apparently, a black bean was cast for a "no" vote and a white bean for a "yes." Whatever his reason for forbidding his students from eating beans, Pythagoras himself ate them quite frequently.<br><br>Old World History<br><br>The broad bean, better known today as the fava bean, originated in the area east of the Mediterranean basin and was initially gathered in the wild as a small-seeded bean. Also known today as the horse or field bean (Vicia faba var. equina), this bean produces a small hard seed used primarily for feeding livestock, although its strong and rich flavor is prized by Mediterranean chefs for making falafel, a bean paste often served fried in balls in a pita. The larger-seeded broad bean (V. faba var. major) was being grown in Egypt by 2400 BCE. From there, the broad bean spread throughout the European continent and became one of the most important staple crops of the medieval period. Monastery records document harvests in the hundreds of �ds. By the 17th century, broad beans came to be associated with the diet of the lower class and fell into disfavor with the gentry. John Parkinson, apothecary and botanist to King James I, referred in 1629 to "our ordinary Beanes, serving for foode for the poorer sort for the most part."<br><br>These beans enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in England in the 18th century, largely because of the great variety of broad beans that had been developed by curious and inventive gardeners, as well as the varieties brought from abroad. There were beans for the spring season and beans for winter, white-flowered beans, red-flowered beans, large beans, and small beans, and they were once again among the commonest components of the kitchen gardens for all classes of English.<br><br>To the New World<br><br>The broad bean never achieved the same degree of popularity in the American garden, but as late as 1865, Fearing Burr was able to list 19 varieties of broad, or "English," beans in The Field and Garden Vegetables of America. The broad bean remains a common vegetable in Europe, but few Americans grow or eat broad beans today. There are several reasons; chief among them is our climate. This useful vegetable prefers a mild, wet climate, such as is found along the central to northern coastal regions of the western United States, which is where you are most likely to encounter the broad bean. The climate over the rest of this country is often too cold in winter, too hot in summer, and too dry at all times to easily grow the broad bean.<br><br>The second reason for our uniquely American oversight is that the preparation of the broad bean for the table is somewhat more demanding than that of the common green bean. Broad beans must first be shelled from the pod, as you would a lima bean. Broad bean skins contain a bitter property that some people find unpleasant. This can be greatly lessened by lightly steaming and then gently pinching each bean, causing the skin to slip off. While it sounds tedious, it actually goes quite quickly, once you master the pinching technique.<br><br>Broad Bean Varieties<br><br>Of the early varieties of broad bean, the most prized in 18th-century England and Virginia was the 'Mazagan'. The Complete Farmer (1766) described this bean as "the first and best sort of early beans at present known." The 'Mazagan' was imported from a Portuguese settlement of the same name on the coast of Africa. Unfortunately, the 'Mazagan' bean seems to have disappeared as a distinct variety, but a number of other early varieties are available from English seed suppliers. 'The Sutton' is perhaps the smallest and finest of modern varieties and may be similar to the 'Mazagan'.<br><br>Broad bean in flower; 'Windsor' beans<br><br>Of the larger, later beans, the most popular 18th-century variety and the variety most commonly available today is the 'Windsor' bean. The Complete Farmer describes it as "the best of all the sorts for the table," explaining that, "when these are planted on a good soil, and are allowed sufficient room, their seeds will be very large, and in great plenty; and when they are gathered young, are the sweetest and best tasted of all the sorts."<br><br>The Williamsburg Gardener's Assistant<br><br>Sowing the bean seed. In mild climates (coastal Virginia and southward), the broad bean is sown in late fall. In colder climates, it should be sown as early in spring as you can possibly work the soil. In Williamsburg, we sow the seed in late November, and it is usually Christmas week before the plants appear aboveground. Germination can be hastened by soaking the seeds, as described by John Abercrombie in 1790: "It is proper, before planting, to soak them several hours in river or pond water, that, when planted, they may come up more freely and regular together." At the same time, you can check the viability of the seeds: Beans that float will not germinate and may be discarded.<br><br>Broad bean seeds are quite large and are best planted with a sharpened stick, known as a dibble, at about 2 inches deep and 6 inches apart, in rows that are 2 feet apart (asunder). After planting, lightly mulch the bed with well-rotted manure. The manure will serve several purposes, as Samuel Trowell advised in 1747: "Put some of the Manure along each Row, but not too thick, for a little will do, which will not only preserve the Bean at the first appearing from Slugs, Snails, or any other Vermin from eating it; and every Shower will feed the Roots." While we have not been troubled by slugs or snails in Williamsburg, a light dressing of composted manure will disguise the newly planted beans from the squirrels, who will take every seed if they discover them. After the seeds are planted, water the rows to set the seed and hasten germination.<br><br>Sowing broad beans with a dibble<br><br>What diligence is required in the care of beans. When beans are planted in fall, the aim of the gardener should be to have plants that are not larger than 2 or 3 inches tall before cold weather arrives. We have found that it is at this size they best stand the trials of winter. In the colder months, it is necessary to provide some cover from the frost. Philip Miller, the best known of the 18th-century English garden writers, advised a mulch of "Peas-haulm, Fern, or some other light Covering, which will secure them from the Injury of Frost." In the Colonial Garden in Williamsburg, we use a somewhat more elaborate device that was recommended in 1573 by the English poet and farmer Thomas Tusser for the raising of strawberries:<br><br>Mature beans and Tuner's trellis;<br><br>topping the bean plants and harvesting beans<br><br> If frost do contin[u]e we, take this for a lawe,<br><br>the strawberies looke, to be covered with straw.<br><br>layde overly trim, uppon crotchis and bowes<br><br>and after uncoverd, as weather alowes.<br><br>In Williamsburg, we find that this loosely woven table, fashioned from tree branches and covered with straw, is equally serviceable for the protection of broad beans. In spring, we reuse it by cutting the lattice in half and standing the sections on end to support the cucumbers.<br><br>Once the danger of frost is over and the plants have begun their spring growth, the woven frame may be removed so that the gardener can work among the plants. By the middle of April in Williamsburg, the plants are "topped" and the suckers removed as explained by Batty Langley in 1728: "When your Beans are in full Blossom pinch off their Tops, and carefully cut away all Suckers that may break out, and grow from the bottom of their Roots." Topping and suckering your plants will produce an earlier crop of fewer but better-formed beans.<br><br>An ingenious method for prolonging the bean harvest. You can split the harvest between an early and a late crop of beans by following an ingenious method related by Richard Bradley in 1718: "I have been told by Mr. Furber of Kensington ... that if we set the Rows about a Foot assunder, suffering them to grow 'till they are almost ready to blossom, and then cut down every other Line within two or three Inches of the Ground, we shall then have a double Crop of Beans from the same Sowing."<br><br>By the middle of May in Williamsburg, the beans will be ready for harvest. They should be picked as young as possible, for they will be less bitter. Modern gardeners have also discovered that the broad bean makes an excellent "green manure" or compost.<br><br>"The Bean Varieties, it would be endless, and well as useless, to describe all its several Kinds."<br><br>&#x2014;Batty Langley (1728)<br><br>Seed Varieties<br><br>Varieties listed in 18th-century Virginia<br><br>� 'Windsor': Large, late season bean, most common of the 18th-century varieties <br>�&nbsp;'Long Podded' and 'White Blossom': Both are likely varieties of the 'Windsor' bean. <br>�&nbsp;'Mazagan': Small, early season bean that is often described as the finest of all varieties; the 'Mazagan' or its ancestor apparently survives in southern Europe. <br>�&nbsp;'Lisbon': Another of the Portuguese beans, such as the 'Mazagan' <br>�&nbsp;'Sandwich' and 'Toker': These two varieties are described as mid-season beans, larger than the 'Mazagan', but smaller and earlier than the 'Windsor'. 'Toker' was advertised in England several years ago. <br>�&nbsp;'Nonpareil', 'Battersea', and 'Hotspur': These three names are used for a number of vegetables. "Nonpareil" is a declaration of quality (without equal). "Battersea" refers to the Battersea area of London where large market gardens were operated in the 18th century. "Hotspur" was more commonly associated with the pea and denoted a smaller-statured early season variety.<br><br>Heirloom varieties for the modern gardener<br><br>�&nbsp;'Windsor': Cold-hardy, with long pods <br>�&nbsp;'The Sutton': Small early bean, perhaps similar to the 'Mazagan' <br>�&nbsp;'Aquadulce': Very similar to 'Windsor', very hardy<br><br>BROAD BEAN ESSENTIALS<br><br>PLANTING In areas where the ground does not freeze, sow in late November, as the last leaves fall. In colder climes, sow as soon as the ground can be worked in spring, when the snowdrops bloom and crocus leaves begin to lengthen.<br><br>SPACING Broad beans can be grown in rows or in a rectangular bed. For row planting, plant the seeds with a dibble 1 to 2 inches deep, 6 inches apart, in rows 2 feet asunder. For beds, plant the seeds on 6-inch centers. Water well.<br><br>FOR BEST GROWTH Broad beans require a long cool season with ample moisture. Removing the top flowers hastens the harvest and provides better-formed beans.<br><br>HARVESTING Pick the beans while the pods are small and before the bean seeds develop a thick skin. Very young beans can be used without skinning the individual beans and are less bitter than older, tougher beans.<br><br>TO SAVE PURE SEED Separate varieties by 1 mile.<br><br>COLLECTING AND STORING SEED Allow beans to dry within the pod while on the plant. Seed saving is more difficult in the South, as the seeds do not develop reliably in hot weather. Shell seeds from pods and store in airtight containers. Refrigerate seeds to prolong viability.<br><br>SEED VIABILITY 6 years</p><h2>Madhur Jaffrey&#39;s Indian Cooking</h2><p>The original edition of this cookbook was called &#34;the definitive word&#34; on Indian cusines by the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.

The text is straightforward, making this book a good entry point into the legend for younger readers. The author maintains a lighthearted tone throughout, building anticipation for Robin's triumph, then adding a final bonus when the Merry Men give a parting gift to the Sheriff, a taunting poem. In an author's note, San Souci explains his research and how his version evolved from other sources. Lewis's watercolor paintings are in the N.C. Wyeth vein, but with a fresh, energetic interpretation. Less idealized than Wyeth's, these characters look like real men. The Sheriff, with his crownlike hat, purple robe, and haughty expression, appears rather regal, but his villain status is clear. Fans of San Souci's collection of Arthurian picture books will be pleased by his take on another classic.<i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Mr. Freedman lives in New York City and travels widely to research his books.Gr. 4^-8. More than 170 years ago, a blind French boy at age 15 invented a system of raised dots on paper that allows the sightless to read and write. Without melodrama, Freedman tells the momentous story in quiet chapters in his best plain style, making the facts immediate and personal. At age 3, Louis Braille was blinded in an accident with a knife. From the age of 12, he worked doggedly, sometimes secretly through the night at a special school in Paris, punching dots on paper, trying to develop a simple code for the alphabet that the blind could read with their fingertips. Woven into the story is an awareness of how the blind child experiences the world, what he remembers. Tension mounts as he refuses to be discouraged by technical and bureaucratic setbacks, until eventually he proves his system to his school and finally to the world. The handsome book design is clear and open. A diagram explains how the Braille alphabet works, and Kate Kessler's full-page shaded pencil illustrations are part of the understated poignant drama. But what about documentation? Is the opening chapter partially fictionalized? No sources are given for the facts and quotes throughout the book, and there's no bibliography. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Nancy Drew 62: The Kachina Doll Mystery</h2><p>When Nancy arrives at the McGuire's fitness ranch in Arizona, she discovers that the future of the ranch is being threatened by unexplained accidents.

By the author of Hottest, Coldest, Highest, Deepest.</p><p>Steve Jenkins has written and illustrated nearly twenty picture books for young readers, including the Caldecott Honor&#x2013;winning What Do You Do with a Tail Like This? His books have been called stunning, eyepopping, inventive, gorgeous, masterful, extraordinary, playful, irresistible, compelling, engaging, accessible, glorious, and informative. He lives in Colorado with his wife and frequent collaborator, Robin Page, and their children. To learn more about Steve and his books, visit www.stevejenkinsbooks.com.Gr. 3^-5. The author-artist who gave us <i>Biggest, Strongest, Fastest</i> (1995) and <i>What Do You Do When Something Wants to Eat You</i> (1997) turns his attention to a slightly older audience in a picture book that takes readers on an armchair tour up the tallest peak on Earth. In preparation for the trek, Jenkins presents some background on Everest (including a brief comment on the ecological nightmare tourism has caused) and on some of the people who have scaled it. There's also a double-page spread devoted to climbing equipment. Then it's up to the top, complete with descriptions of some of the things climbers may see en route and some insight into how the cold and altitude will affect their bodies. Jenkins' papercut illustrations are extraordinary--feathery light to catch the effect of fog radiating off the mountains, mottled and striated to replicate rocky plateaus, pebbled to look like ice flowers. The typeface is sometimes uncomfortably small, and words occasionally disappear into the strongly colored backgrounds, but this is still a very attractive book, with plenty of substance for curious children. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>15-Minute Yoga: Health, Well-Being, and Happiness through Daily Practice</h2><p>From Ulrica Norberg, a renowned yoga teacher and author, comes <i>15-Minute Yoga</i>, a guide to beneficial yoga poses and nutritional tips for practitioners of all levels.

The cherubic felines on the front cover invite readers to follow their mishaps from acquiring the mittens, to losing them, to finding them, to getting them all dirty, to washing them, and&#x2013;judging from the exuberance of the final spread&#x2013;losing them again. Pinkney's energetic kittens need every inch of each spread to tell their story. Their mother, who has been represented in past versions as rather fearsome when the kittens confess their carelessness, is gentler here, although clearly long-suffering. Still, she has a sighing patience that children will find comforting. The ability of the youngsters to turn their carelessness into play (finding the lost mittens becomes a counting game, and they seem to have as much fun washing the pie-covered mittens as they did getting them dirty in the first place) is a hidden charm to the rhyme that is developed here; details such as a red cardinal reflected in a stray bubble escaping the washing tub has more "cheer" than "chore" in it. The palette of autumn colors is warm, despite the evidence of mittens and scarves, and the use of white space for the background makes the illustrations sparkle. This is another superb entry in the artist's catalog of classics for a new generation.<i>Kara Schaff Dean, Walpole Public Library, MA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Using the architecture, sculpture, and stained glass of the two locales as a starting point, Adams breathes life into what others might see merely as monuments of a past civilization. With daring and inventive conceits, Adams looks at the ordinary people, places, and events in the context of the social conventions and systems of thought and belief of the thirteenth century turning the study of history into a kind of theater.<p>As Raymond Carney discusses in his introduction, Adams' freeedom from the European traditions of study lends an exuberance&#x2014;and puckish wit&#x2014;to his writings.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.&nbsp;</p></p><p><br> <p>"<i>Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres</i> is undoubtedly Adams's greatest work; though not apparently related to his earlier writings, this inspired work of poetry is the crowning achievement of his severe and somber historical oeuvre."<b>--Maurice le Breton</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"Emerson discussed man's need to discover a system of unity for his age; Henry Adams did the same for an age when the conflict was infinitely more acute and the solution less apparently obvious."<b>--Robert Spiller</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"One has the feeling that during the process of writing, the book grew way beyond its original plan and intention to be the informal travel talk of an art tourist, or an art-uncle for nieces with Kodaks. At a certain point it almost ceases to deal with esthetic experiences and becomes a confession of a seeker after unity, of a pilgrim who hopes to find in the Middle Ages an emotional repose-peace-Nirvana."<b>--Ernst Scheyer, <i>The Circle of Henry Adams</i><br> </b><br> </p> <br>Born in 1838 into one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Boston, a family which had produced two American presidents, <b>Henry Adams</b> had the opportunity to pursue a wide-ranging variety of intellectual interests during the course of his life. Functioning both in the world of practical men and afffairs (as a journalist and an assistant to his father, who was an American diplomat in Washinton and London), and in the world of ideas (as a prolific writer, the editor of the prestigious <b>North American Review</b>, and a professor of medieval, european, and American history at Harvard), Adams was one of the few men of his era who attempted to understand art, thought, culture, and history as one complex force field of interacting energies. His two masterworks in this dazzling effort are <b>Mont Saint Michel and Chartres</b> and <b>The Education of Henry Adams</b>, published one after the other in 1904 and 1907. Taken together they may be read as Adams' spiritual autobiography&#x2014;two monumental volumes in which he attempts to bring together into a vast synthesis all of his knowledge of politics, economics, psychology, science, philosophy, art, and literature in order to attempt to understand the individual's place in history and society. They constitute one of the greatest historical and philosophical meditations on the human condition in all of literature.<br><br><b>Raymond Carney</b> is well known for his writing on the relationships between American art, thought, and culture. He has been a Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, served as an artistic consultant to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and written extensively on American and British poetry, ficiton, drama, dance, painting, and film.

Jenni recommended this book as 'perfect, just read it' and she was right. From the very first page I was deep in the headspace of our protagonist, Esther, a woman willing to destroy her life for a man who barely acknowledges her. This slim volume explores the power dynamic cultural capital and fame bring to a relationship, and the lengths we're willing to go to in order to imagine we're getting what we want. Jenni said: 'I want to give this to every person I know who is in a one sided relationship. This will snap them right out of it.'" --Lena Dunham</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Ester Nilsson is a sensible person in a sensible relationship. Until the day she is asked to give a lecture on famous artist Hugo Rask. The man himself is in the audience, intrigued and clearly delighted by her fascination with him. When the two meet afterward, she is spellbound.<br><br>Ester&#x2019;s life is then intrinsically linked to this meeting and the chain of events that unfolds.&nbsp;She leaves her boyfriend and throws herself into an imaginary relationship with Hugo. She falls deeply in love, and he consumes her thoughts. Indeed, in her own mind she&#x2019;s&nbsp;sure that she and Hugo are a couple.<br> Slowly and painfully Ester comes to realize that her perception of the relationship is different from his. She&#x2019;s a woman who prides herself on having a rational and analytical mind, but in the face of her overpowering feelings for Hugo, she is too clever and too honest for her own good. Bitingly funny and darkly fascinating, <i>Willful Disregard</i> is a story about total and desperate devotion, and how willingly we betray ourselves in the pursuit of love.<br>&nbsp; <br></p></p><p><b>Lena Andersson</b> is a novelist and a columnist for <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, Sweden&#x2019;s largest morning paper.

But dissension among the regular army, the militia, and De Gaulle&#x2019;s Free French forces allows black marketers in league with the Germans to divert medical supplies, leading to multiple murders. Billy must find the killers and rescue the woman he loves, a British spy.</p><p>James R. Benn is the author of the Billy Boyle World War II mysteries. The debut, <i>Billy Boyle</i>, was named one of five top mysteries of 2006 by Book Sense and was a Dilys Award nominee.<i> A Blind Goddess </i>was longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, and <i>The Rest Is Silence</i> was a Barry Award nominee. A librarian for many years, Benn lives in Connecticut with his wife, Deborah Mandel.Like Mark Frost in The Second Objective (2007), Benn builds his Billy Boyle series around little-known snippets of World War II history: Billy Boyle (2006) concerned a proposed Allied invasion of Norway, and this time the focus is on Eisenhower&#39;s plan to invade Vichy-held Algeria, anticipating a quick surrender by the French. It doesn&#39;t happen quite like that, and along the way, Boyle, a special investigator with Eisenhower&#39;s staff, finds himself trying to solve a series of murders connected to black marketeers and working to rescue the captured British spy with whom he fell in love in the first book. The unusual premises are the best part of this series and will be certain to appeal to WWII fiction fans, though Benn continues to struggle with the nuts and bolts of character development and plotting. The identity of the Allied traitor is obvious early on, and the interpersonal relationships still fall prey to the kind of melodrama associated with WWII tearjerkers. Still, Benn is improving from book to book, and as his storytelling skills inch closer to his feel for the historical moment, this series could come into its own. Ott, Bill</p><h2>Landscape Painting</h2><p>Underpinning all good landscape painting is observation. Starting from this standpoint, this book introduces the artist to painting the natural and man-made landscape. Initially equipped with just a handful of pencils and paper to explore the world outside, it allows confidence to grow alongside an understanding of the art and craft of painting landscape. Written by artist Richard Pikesley, it demonstrates his approach and that of other contributors, who illustrate the diversity of paths that can be taken to achieve a passionate and personal response to the landscape. Richly illustrated with more than 300 color images, this book emphasizes the importance of observation, and advises on how to &#34;learn&#34; the landscape; it teaches the rudiments of drawing, and develops confidence and technical understanding of the subject; it explains color mixing on the palette, and how color works in nature and is affected by sunlight. Also included is a guide to the materials, equipment, and techniques of the landscape painter. Finally, there is advice on presenting, framing, and displaying your work, and how to find exhibition opportunities.</p><p><b>Richard Pikesley </b>is a professional artist and teacher. Painting landscape has always been the central part of his output, working in oils, watercolor and printmaking. As a qualified and experienced teacher, he has worked alongside novice and emerging artists, and leads painting trips and courses in the UK and abroad. Elected to membership of the prestigious New English Art Club at the age of 23, he has recently served as its president. He is a member of the royal Watercolour Society, and exhibits in solo and group exhibitions all over the UK, as well as contributing to many exhibitions across the world.</p><h2>Battling Unbelief: Defeating Sin with Superior Pleasure</h2><p><b>Pastor John Piper shows how to sever the clinging roots of sin that ensnare us, including anxiety, pride, shame, impatience, covetousness, bitterness, despondency, and lust in <i>Battling Unbelief</i>.<br><br></b>When faith flickers, stoke the fire. <br><br>No one sins out of duty. We sin because it offers some promise of happiness. That promise enslaves us, until we believe that God is more desirable than life itself (Psalm 63:3). Only the power of God&#x2019;s superior promises in the gospel can emancipate our hearts from servitude to the shallow promises and fleeting pleasures of sin.<br><br> Delighting in the bounty of God&#x2019;s glorious gospel promises will free us for a less sin-encumbered life, to the glory of Christ. Rooted in solid biblical reflection, this book aims to help guide you through the battles to the joys of victory by the power of the gospel and its superior pleasure.</p><p><b>John Piper</b> is the founder of desiringGod.org and chancellor of Bethlehem College and Seminary.

I became so nervous that my voice would completely choke up. It was not the common butterflies that most people deal with. It was a horrible and humiliating disability. It brought immense anxiety into my life. I could not give oral book reports in school. I couldn&#x2019;t run for any class offices at school, because I would have had to make campaign speeches. I could only give very short&#x2013;several word&#x2013;answers to the questions teachers would ask in class. In algebra class I was ashamed of how my hands shook when doing a problem on the blackboard. I couldn&#x2019;t lead out on the Sundays when our church gave the service over to the youth.<br><br>There were many tears. My mother struggled with me through it all, supporting me and encouraging me. We were sustained by God&#x2019;s grace, even though the &#x201c;thorn&#x201d; in my flesh was not removed. I managed to make it to college without any significant public speaking. But the battle with anxiety was intense. I knew that my life would be incredibly limited if there were no breakthrough. And I suspected that I would not be able to get through college without public speaking. In fact, Wheaton College required a speech class in those days. It loomed in front of me like a horrible concrete barricade.<br><br>In all these years, the grace of God had driven me deeper into God in desperation, rather than driving me away from God in anger. I thank God for that, with all my heart. Out of that maturing relationship came the sense that there just had to be a breakthrough.<br><br>One crucial opportunity came in Spanish class my freshman year. All of us had to give a short speech in Spanish in front of the rest of the class. There was no way around it. I felt like this was a make-or-break situation. Even as I write about it now, I don&#x2019;t laugh. I memorized the speech cold. I thought that memorizing would mean that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to look down at notes, and possibly lose my place, and have one of those horrible, paralyzing pauses. I also arranged to speak from behind a large tree-stump lectern that I could hold onto so that my shaking might be better controlled. But the main thing I did was cry out to God and lay hold on his promises of future grace. Even now the tears come to my eyes as I recall walking back and forth on Wheaton&#x2019;s front campus, pleading with God for a breakthrough in my life.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember those three moments of Spanish very clearly. I only remember that I made it through. Everyone knew I was nervous. There was that terrible silence that falls when people feel bad for you and don&#x2019;t know how to respond. But they didn&#x2019;t snicker, as so many kids had done in previous years. And the teacher was kind with his comments. But the overwhelming thing was that I got through it. Later I poured out my thanks to God in the autumn sunshine. Even now I feel deep gratitude for the grace God gave me that day.<br><br>Perhaps the most decisive event of the breakthrough came over a year later. I was staying at college for summer school. Chaplain Evan Welch invited me to pray in the summer school chapel. Several hundred students and faculty would be present. My first reaction was immediate rejection of the idea. But before I could turn it down, something stopped me. I found myself asking, &#x201c;How long does the prayer have to be?&#x201d; He said it didn&#x2019;t matter. It should just be from my heart.<br><br>Now this I had never even tried&#x2013;to speak to God in front of hundreds of people. I amazed myself by saying I would do it. This prayer, I believe, proved to be a decisive turning point in my life. For the first time, I made a vow to God. I said, &#x201c;Lord, if you will bring me through this without letting my voice break, I will never again turn down a speaking opportunity for you out of anxiety.&#x201d; That was 1966. The Lord answered with precious grace again, and to my knowledge, I have kept my vow.<br><br>There is more to the story as one future grace has been lavished on another. I do not presume to understand fully all the purposes of God in his timing. I would not want to relive my high-school years. The anxiety, the humiliation and shame, were so common, as to cast a pall over all those years. Hundreds of prayers went up, and what came down was not what I wanted at the time&#x2013;the grace to endure. My interpretation now, thirty years later, is that God was keeping me back from excessive vanity and worldliness. He was causing me to ponder weighty things in solitude, while many others were breezily slipping into superficial patterns of life.<br><br>The Bible my parents gave me when I was fifteen is beside me right now on the table. It is well-marked. The assurance of Matthew 6:32 is underlined in red: &#x201c;Your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things&#x201d; (KJV). Already in those early teen years I was struggling to live by faith in future grace. The victories were modest, it seems. But, oh, how faithful and kind God has been.<br><br>The Associates of Anxiety<br><br>In the decades that have followed I have learned much more about the fight against anxiety. I have learned, for instance, that anxiety is a condition of the heart that gives rise to many other sinful states of mind. Think for a moment how many different sinful actions and attitudes come from anxiety. Anxiety about finances can give rise to coveting and greed and hoarding and stealing. Anxiety about succeeding at some task can make you irritable and abrupt and surly. Anxiety about relationships can make you withdrawn and indifferent and uncaring about other people. Anxiety about how someone will respond to you can make you cover over the truth and lie about things. So if anxiety could be conquered, a mortal blow would be struck to many other sins.<br><br>The Root of Anxiety<br><br>I have also learned something about the <i>root </i>of anxiety and the ax that can sever it. One of the most important texts has been the one I underlined when I was fifteen&#x2013;the whole section of Matthew 6:25&#x2014;34. Four times in this passage Jesus says that his disciples should not be anxious. Verse 25: &#x201c;Do not be anxious about your life.&#x201d; Verse 27: &#x201c;Which of you by<br>being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?&#x201d; Verse 31: &#x201c;Do not be anxious, saying, &#x2018;What shall we eat?&#x2019;&#x201d; Verse 34: &#x201c;Do not be anxious about tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Anxiety is clearly the theme of this text. It makes the root of anxiety explicit in verse 30: &#x201c;But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little <i>faith</i>?&#x201d; In other words, Jesus says that the root of anxiety is inadequate faith in our Father&#x2019;s future grace. As unbelief gets the upper hand in our hearts, one of the effects is anxiety. The root cause of anxiety is a failure to trust all that God has promised to be for us in Jesus.<br><br>I can think of two kinds of disturbed responses to this truth. Let me tell you what they are and then give a biblical response to each of them before we look more closely at the battle against the unbelief of anxiety.<br><br>Is This Good News?<br><br>One response would go like this: &#x201c;This is not good news! In fact, it is very discouraging to learn that what I thought was a mere struggle with an anxious disposition is rather a far deeper struggle with whether I trust God.&#x201d; My response to this is to agree, but then to disagree. Suppose you had been having pain in your stomach and had been struggling with medicines and diets of all kinds to no avail. And then suppose that your doctor tells you, after a routine visit, that you have cancer in your small intestine. Would that be good news? You say: Emphatically not! And I agree.<br><br>But let me ask the question another way: Are you glad the doctor discovered the cancer while it is still treatable, and that indeed it can be very successfully treated? You say, yes, I am very glad that the doctor found the real problem. Again I agree. So finding out that you have cancer is not good news. It&#x2019;s bad news. But, in another sense, it is good to find out, because knowing what is really wrong is good, especially when your problem can be treated successfully.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s like to learn that the real problem behind anxiety is unbelief in the promises of God&#x2019;s future grace. In a sense, it&#x2019;s not good news, because the unbelief is a very serious cancer. But in another sense it is good news because knowing what is really wrong is good, especially because unbelief can be treated so successfully by our Great Physician. He is able to work in wonderfully healing ways when we cry out, &#x201c;I believe; help my unbelief!&#x201d; (Mark 9:24).<br><br>So I want to stress that finding out the connection between our anxiety and our unbelief is, in fact, very good news, because it is the only way to focus our fight on the real cause of our sin and get the victory that God can give us by the therapy of his Word and his Spirit. When Paul said, &#x201c;Fight the <i>good </i>fight of faith,&#x201d; (1 Timothy 6:12), he called it <i>good </i>because the fight is focused on exactly the right cancer: unbelief.<br><br>How Can I Have Any Assurance at All?<br><br>There is another possible response to the truth that our anxiety is rooted in our failure to live by faith in future grace. It goes like this: &#x201c;I have to deal with feelings of anxiety almost every day; and so I feel like my faith in God&#x2019;s grace must be totally inadequate. So I wonder if I can have any assurance of being saved at all.&#x201d;<br><br>My response to this concern is a little different. Suppose you are in a car race and your enemy, who doesn&#x2019;t want you to finish the race, throws mud on your windshield. The fact that you temporarily lose sight of your goal, and start to swerve, does not mean that you are going to quit the race. And it certainly doesn&#x2019;t mean that you are on the wrong race track. Otherwise the enemy wouldn&#x2019;t bother you at all. What it means is that you should turn on your windshield wipers and use your windshield washer.<br><br>When anxiety strikes and blurs our vision of God&#x2019;s glory and the greatness of the future that he plans for us, this does not mean that we are faithless, or that we will not make it to heaven. It means our faith is being attacked. At first blow, our belief in God&#x2019;s promises may sputter and swerve. But whether we stay on track and make it to the finish line depends on whether, by grace, we set in motion a process of resistance&#x2013;whether we fight back against the unbelief of anxiety. Will we turn on the windshield wipers and will we use our windshield washer?<br><br>Psalm 56:3 says, &#x201c;When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.&#x201d; Notice it does not say, &#x201c;I never struggle with fear.&#x201d; Fear strikes, and the battle begins. So the Bible does not assume that true believers will have no anxieties. Instead, the Bible tells us how to fight when they strike. For example, 1 Peter 5:7 says, &#x201c;[Cast] all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.&#x201d; It does <i>not </i>say, You will never feel any anxieties. It says, When you have them, cast them on God. When the mud splatters your windshield and you temporarily lose sight of the road and start to swerve in anxiety, turn on your wipers and squirt your windshield washer fluid.<br><br>So my response to the person who has to deal with feelings of anxiety every day is to say, That&#x2019;s more or less normal. At least it is for me, ever since my teenage years. The issue is, how do we fight them?<br><br>The Two Great Faith Builders<br><br>The answer to that question is: We fight anxieties by fighting <i>against </i>unbelief and fighting <i>for </i>faith in future grace. And the way you fight this &#x201c;good fight&#x201d; is by meditating on God&#x2019;s assurances of future grace and by asking for the help of his Spirit. The windshield wipers are the promises of God that clear away the mud of unbelief, and the windshield washer fluid is the help of the Holy Spirit. The battle to be freed from sin is &#x201c;by the <i>Spirit</i>&#x201d; (Romans 15:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2) and by &#x201c;the truth&#x201d; (John 17:17, 19). The work of the Spirit and the Word of truth&#x2013;especially the foundational truth of the gospel that guarantees all the promises of God. These are the great faith builders.<br><br>Without the softening work of the Holy Spirit, the wipers of the Word just scrape over the blinding clumps of unbelief. Both are necessary&#x2013;the Spirit and the Word. We read the promises of God and we pray for the help of his Spirit. And as the windshield clears so that we can see the welfare that God plans for us (Jeremiah 29:11), our faith grows stronger and the swerving of anxiety smoothes out.<br><br>Seven Promises of Future Grace Against Anxiety<br><br>How does this actually work in practice? Here in Matthew 6 we have the example of anxiety about food and clothing. Even in America, with its extensive welfare system, anxiety over finances and housing can be intense. But Jesus says in verse 30 that this stems from inadequate faith in our Father&#x2019;s promise of future grace: &#x201c;O you of <i>little faith</i>.&#x201d; And so this paragraph has at least seven promises designed by Jesus to help us fight the good fight against unbelief and be free from anxiety.<br><b><i><br>Promise #1<br></i></b><br>Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? (Matthew 6:25)<br><br>This is an argument from the greater to the lesser. If God does the greater, then doing the lesser is all the more sure. In this verse, the greater thing is that God has given us life and bodies. These are vastly more complex and difficult to maintain than the mere provision of clothing. Yet God has done it. Therefore, how much more easily can God provide us with food and clothing. Moreover, no matter what happens, God will raise your body someday and preserve your life for his eternal fellowship.<br><b><i><br>Promise #2<br></i></b><br>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? (Matthew 6:26)<br><br>If God is willing and able to feed such insignificant creatures as birds who cannot do anything to bring their food into being&#x2013;as you can by farming&#x2013;then he will certainly provide what you need, because you are worth a lot more than birds.<br><b><i><br>Promise #3<br></i></b><br>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? (Matthew 6:27&#x2014;28)<br><br>This is a promise of sorts&#x2013;the simple promise of reality: Anxiety will not do you any good. It&#x2019;s not the main argument, but sometimes we just have to get tough with ourselves and say, &#x201c;Soul, this fretting is absolutely useless. You are not only messing up your own day, but a lot of other people&#x2019;s as well. Leave it with God and get on with your work.&#x201d; Anxiety accomplishes nothing worthwhile.<br><br><b><i>Promise #4<br></i></b><br>Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? (Matthew 6:28&#x2014;30)<br><br>Compared to the flowers of the field you are a much higher priority for God, because you will live forever, and can thus bring him eternal praise. Nevertheless, God has such an overflow of creative energy and care, he lavishes it on flowers that last only a matter of days. So he will certainly take that same energy and creative skill and use it to care for his children who will live forever.<br><b><i><br>Promise #5<br></i></b><br>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, &#x2018;What shall we eat...</p><h2>Justice Denied (J. P. Beaumont Novel, 18)</h2><p><p>The murder of an ex-drug dealer ex-con&#x2014;gunned down on his mother's doorstep&#x2014;seems just another turf war fatality. Why then has Seattle homicide investigator J.P. Beaumont been instructed to keep this assignment hush-hush? Meanwhile, Beau's lover and fellow cop, Mel Soames, is involved in her own confidential investigation. Registered sex offenders from all over Washington State are dying at an alarming rate&#x2014;and not all due to natural causes.</p><p>A metropolis the size of Seattle holds its fair share of brutal crime, corruption, and dirty little secrets. But when the separate trails they're following begin to shockingly intertwine, Beau and Mel realize that they have stumbled onto something bigger and more frightening than they anticipated&#x2014;a deadly conspiracy that's leading them to lofty places they should not enter . . . and may not be allowed to leave alive.</p></p><p><p>J. A. Jance is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the J. P. Beaumont series, the Joanna Brady series, the Ali Reynolds series, and five interrelated thrillers about the Walker family, as well as a volume of poetry. Born in South Dakota and brought up in Bisbee, Arizona, Jance lives with her husband in Seattle, Washington, and Tucson, Arizona.</p>In bestseller Jance's complex, overlong 18th J.P. Beaumont novel (after <i>Long Time Gone</i>), the Seattle special homicide investigator works three cases simultaneously. The first involves the murder of a wrongly imprisoned ex-con, the second the disappearance of a whistle-blowing electronics engineer who vanished the day Mount Saint Helen's erupted in 1980, the third the deaths of several former felons. Meanwhile, Mel Soames, Beau's female colleague and lover, looks into the unexplained deaths of recently released sex crimes perpetrators as well as the disappearance of a childhood friend's abusive father. Unbelievably, all Beaumont's and Mel's assignments meld into one, except for the case of the missing engineer. The detectives are helped by the delightful Todd Hatcher, a young forensic economist and statistical analyst, but the exceptionally busy plot, host of characters, incredible coincidences, ignored clues and red herrings add up to a less than stellar effort from the usually reliable Jance. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Masur's <em>The Civil War: A Concise History</em> offers a masterful and eminently readable overview of the war's multiple causes and catastrophic effects. Masur begins by examining the complex origins of the war, focusing on the pulsating tensions over states rights and slavery. The book then proceeds to cover, year by year, the major political, social, and military events, highlighting two important themes: how the war shifted from a limited conflict to restore the Union to an all out war that would fundamentally transform Southern society, and the process by which the war ultimately became a battle to abolish slavery. Masur explains how the war turned what had been a loose collection of fiercely independent states into a nation, remaking its political, cultural, and social institutions. But he also focuses on the soldiers themselves, both Union and Confederate, whose stories constitute nothing less than America's <em>Iliad</em>. In the final chapter Masur considers the aftermath of the South's surrender at Appomattox and the clash over the policies of reconstruction that continued to divide President and Congress, conservatives and radicals, Southerners and Northerners for years to come. <br> In 1873, Mark Twain and Charles Dudley wrote that the war had "wrought so profoundly upon the entire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or three generations." From the vantage of the war's sesquicentennial, this concise history of the entire Civil War era offers an invaluable introduction to the dramatic events whose effects are still felt today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Louis P. Masur</strong> is Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at Rutgers University. His many books include <em>Lincoln's Last Speech: Wartime Reconstruction and the Crisis of Reunion</em> (OUP, 2015), <em>Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union</em>,<em> </em>and<em> "the real</em> <em>war will never get in the books": Selections from Writers during the Civil War</em> (OUP, 1993).<br><br>"Masur's pocket-sized chronological account of the Civil War packs a powerful punch It is hard to overstate this accomplishment, as so many have tried before and failed." --<em>H-Net</em><p></p><br>"A short history of the Civil War is a daunting task to say the least, so complex and wide-ranging is the story, yet Louis P.

More than 50 million Americans have GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, and while antacids can be effective for short-term relief, they can also cause dangerous medical conditions if they&#x2019;re used for more than the recommended fifty days at a time. Luckily, <i>The Acid Reflux Solution</i> offers a simple plan to help you gradually and safely reduce&#x2014;and eventually eliminate&#x2014;the need for pills while alleviating your heartburn.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this combination medical guide and cookbook, gastroenterologist Jorge E. Rodriguez, MD, has teamed up with registered dietitian and food writer Susan Wyler to present a three-step program to heal heartburn naturally. This isn&#x2019;t a formal diet plan&#x2014;no calorie counting required&#x2014;but you&#x2019;ll probably shed some pounds while following <i>The Acid Reflux Solution</i> because these recipes were designed for good health. In fact, Dr. Jorge has not only healed his own heartburn since developing this plan, but he has also lost more than 30 pounds! <br> &nbsp;<br> In step one you make some simple lifestyle modifications, like raising the head of your bed, loosening your belt, and eating less but more often. These are easily achievable goals that you can start working on today. In step two, you start eating to avoid reflux. With 100 high-fiber, low-fat, portion-controlled recipes to choose from, this step is the most delicious&#x2014;and surprising. The list of foods that actually trigger acid reflux is smaller than you might think, which means you can enjoy meals that you probably thought were off limits, like <b>Cuban Black Bean Soup</b>, <b>Grass-Fed Beef and Portobello Blue Cheese Burgers</b>, <b>Asian Barbecued Chicken</b>, and even <b>Spaghetti and Meatballs</b>. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the final step, you reduce the dosage and frequency of the medications you were taking to control your heartburn because you won&#x2019;t need them anymore. <i>The Acid Reflux Solution</i> combines the latest medical research with reflux-friendly recipes to help you feel great, lose weight, and live heartburn free.</p><p><b>Jorge E.

In fact, you&#x2019;ve got way too much company. In the United States, over 50 million Americans complain of acid reflux. That&#x2019;s one-sixth of the entire population. Roughly 44 percent report an attack at least once a week. More than 23 million people experience episodes of heartburn daily. Even for a physician like me, who sees gastrointestinal patients regularly, the numbers appear staggering; but as a person who suffers (or I should say, has suffered) from acid reflux, it is reassuring to know that I am not alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> What&#x2019;s particularly sad is that this disease distorts one of life&#x2019;s most primary pleasures: eating. Unlike other diseases, you cannot avoid food, one of the primary causes of heartburn. You have to eat&#x2014;at least three times a day&#x2014;so it&#x2019;s not something you can ignore. I for one thought paying the price of heartburn after every meal was something I was going to have to do all my life. Happily, I was wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i> The Skinny on Acid Reflux</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Acute acid reflux, as anyone who suffers from it knows, is a sudden burning surge of stomach acid that flares up into the throat, much like the lava of an erupting volcano. And like lava, it burns everything in its path. The stomach makes acid to help digest food that has recently been eaten. Ideally, that acid should stay in the stomach. But sometimes it shoots up into the esophagus. This is reflux. Reflux usually occurs about an hour after a meal, but it may affect you shortly after you eat. Or maybe it wakes you up suddenly at night hours after you&#x2019;ve eaten. I have many patients who swear the accompanying chest pain is so severe they think they&#x2019;re having a heart attack. <br> &nbsp;<br> We doctors call this sudden, uncontrollable surge of stomach acid gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Because acid reflux is the primary symptom and major complaint of the disease, the term is often used as a stand-in for GERD. Another frequently used name for the same problem is heartburn, which is most descriptive. For simplicity&#x2019;s sake, we will do the same. In <i>The Acid Reflux Solution</i>, you&#x2019;ll find these terms used synonymously along with GERD. <br> &nbsp;<br> GERD can manifest itself in many ways. Reflux can be so painful that maybe you&#x2019;re afraid to eat. And while obesity is, in fact, associated with GERD, some of my patients avoid food to such an extent that they lose way too much weight, and I worry about malnutrition and their susceptibility to infections. Others lie awake at night, losing valuable sleep time, fearfully waiting for an attack. Worse still, chronic acid reflux causes scarring that produces esophageal strictures, which can make it difficult or even impossible for food to get to the stomach. A further stage of chronic inflammation of the esophagus is a precancerous condition called Barrett&#x2019;s esophagus, diagnosed by a serious change in the epithelial tissues. GERD is even associated with 60 percent of malignant esophageal adenocarcinomas that line the esophagus&#x2014;the fastest growing cancer in America&#x2014;that occurs in the area where the esophagus joins up with the stomach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i> Who Gets Acid Reflux?</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Though it may seem improbable, GERD strikes people of all ages. Babies, especially those who are not breast-fed, often suffer from acid reflux. You&#x2019;ve heard of a &#x201c;colicky&#x201d; baby? Well, that colic is regurgitation of undigested milk or formula mixed with stomach acid. The cranky, crying, fussy behavior too often attributed to a defect of personality is an expression of pain. <br> &nbsp;<br> Young adults are also not immune. At an age when the tendency to overindulge is greatest, we tend to think we&#x2019;re immortal, eating and drinking as if there were no tomorrow. Unfortunately, as anyone who has overindulged at a frat party knows, drinking too much does not come without consequences. How many people have not been woken up by a little bit of acid or bile in their mouth after a long night of celebration? Gross, indeed, but one of the body&#x2019;s early warning signs. If occasional bouts of excess lead to heartburn or even acid reflux, it is usually transitory, and the occasional Alka-Seltzer tablet or swig of Pepto Bismol may be all that&#x2019;s needed. But if drinking&#x2014;and eating&#x2014;to excess occurs frequently and continues long enough, heartburn and indigestion can become chronic problems. Symptoms of esophageal discomfort or pain that occur at least once a week can be symptomatic of more serious issues.<br> &nbsp;<br> People over fifty, though, suffer the greatest frequency of GERD, which may be no surprise. As we age, our bodies lose the ability to compensate, as any middle-aged &#x201c;weekend warrior&#x201d; can attest to. The joints don&#x2019;t work as well, and it should be no surprise that our digestive system also undergoes changes with age. Old bad habits, which we can often tolerate in younger years, begin to take their toll. And stress can cause more overeating and too much drinking. Another sad but true fact not to forget is that as we Americans get older, we are prone to getting heavier, and as I mentioned before, overweight and obesity are strongly associated with GERD, something we&#x2019;ll discuss in depth later on. <br> &nbsp;<br> Two major changes in the population have given rise to the high prevalence of acid reflux. One is the concurrent epidemic of obesity in America. We already know that as a country, we have an issue with food; we love it too much! Let&#x2019;s face it, with 70 percent of the population overweight and one-third of those so obese it threatens not only their quality of life but also their life expectancy, we know something&#x2019;s wrong with the way we eat.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> The second major factor contributing to the huge number of people suffering from GERD is the aging of the population. As more and more baby boomers reach the age of sixty-five and the proportion of older adults nearly doubles by 2030 from what it was a decade ago, the proportion of people suffering from acid reflux is going nowhere but up. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i> Signs and Symptoms of Acid Reflux</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> While many older adults suffer from GERD, their symptoms are sometimes less obvious and often more serious. They will attribute a sour taste in the mouth to a touch of indigestion or dismiss chronic dry cough to the air conditioning or allergies. (I know more than one person who went to the emergency room claiming they had a bad stomach flu only to find out their coronary arteries were completely clogged and they&#x2019;d gotten there just in the nick of time.) Acid reflux can even cause tooth decay and mimic symptoms of ulcers (abdominal pain, nausea) and asthma (coughing, wheezing), causing misdiagnoses and years of unnecessary suffering. <br> &nbsp;<br> Fully one-third of people who think they have asthma actually suffer from GERD. They develop the characteristic wheezing and difficulty breathing from aspirating acid. Remember that stomach acid we&#x2019;ve sometimes tasted after too much partying? At times, the backflow slips down into the lungs, causing irritation that triggers bronchial spasms and other symptoms that are exactly the same as asthma. Once we treat the GERD, the asthma symptoms go away. <br> &nbsp;<br> Just the other day I had a patient who is a doctor himself. He suffered from severe asthma for three years before his rheumatologist suggested he be tested for GERD. We attached a BRAVO chip (more on this in a minute) to his esophagus and determined that even though he was one of those people who doesn&#x2019;t feel the acid, he was refluxing regularly and severely. In his case, medications did not help, and there was a physical repair needed. Once it was accomplished, his &#x201c;asthma&#x201d; disappeared. Amazing, but true.<br> &nbsp;<br> So how do you know if you are suffering from GERD, or if you&#x2019;re having a heart attack? How can you be sure it&#x2019;s just heartburn? <br> &nbsp;<br> Possible symptoms of GERD include:<br> &nbsp;<br> � Frequent heartburn<br> � Hoarse or raspy voice <br> � Wheezing and shortness of breath<br> � Persistent dry cough<br> � Feeling like you have a lump in your throat or food stuck in your chest<br> � Difficulty swallowing <br> � Pitting or discoloration of the teeth <br> � Feeling full too soon<br> � Chronic sore throat<br> � Trouble getting a restful night&#x2019;s sleep<br> &nbsp;<br> Fewer than half of the more than 50 million people suffering from acid reflux actually seek medical help, usually those who cannot sleep at night. In fact, more than a quarter of all Americans self-medicate for symptoms of acid reflux more than two times a month. But the fact that acid reflux can disguise itself as other diseases is a really strong argument for not diagnosing it yourself. Self-diagnosis usually leads to lack of objectivity. We tend to downplay important symptoms or accentuate minor ones. Diagnosing yourself is a little like trying to fly. If you&#x2019;re estimating the distance below you as only two feet and you&#x2019;re correct, when you take off, you&#x2019;re in the clear. If it&#x2019;s a fifty-foot drop, you&#x2019;re toast. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i> Diagnosing GERD</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> How do you find out for sure if you are suffering from acid reflux? There&#x2019;s a nifty new device called a BRAVO chip. It&#x2019;s a tiny computer and transmitter designed to measure pH, or acid level, which is attached to a microscopic suction cup. The instrument is threaded down the throat of the patient, pressed onto the esophagus, and left in place. The device senses every change in esophageal pH and transmits this information in real time to a receiving monitor secured onto the patient&#x2019;s belt, much like a pacemaker. Basically, it gives the doctor a chart of when and how often the &#x201c;acid volcano&#x201d; erupts. It also tells how far the acid travels. A physician like me can read the printout and see exactly if and when acid washes back up into the esophagus. The chip stays there for two days, so that a good picture is relayed of just what is going on during eating, sleeping, exercising, and other activities. After a couple of days, it simply slips off and is washed out to sea, as it were, with the next bowel movement. But by then, I&#x2019;ve got all the information I need.<br> &nbsp;<br> To be sure, not everyone needs a BRAVO chip to diagnose GERD. Quite simply, your physician may decide based on your symptoms alone that you have GERD. But you must be sure it is not a cardiovascular problem that is giving you that pain in your chest in the middle of the night and that you do need the medications you are taking while you are transitioning into your new healthy lifestyle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyone popping even ordinary antacids, let alone powerful proton pump inhibitors, had better be sure they need them. A medical professional should also make sure those antacids are not interfering with other medications or contributing to chronic physiological problems. These pills, while effective, are not benign, and I believe strongly that airing the very real consequences of chronic use may help patients take a closer look at their treatment plan and consider some natural alternatives, such as the ones presented in <i>The Acid Reflux Solution</i>.</p><h2>This Little Art</h2><p>An essay with the reach and momentum of a novel, Kate Briggs&#x2019;s <i>This Little Art</i> is a genre-bending song for the practice of literary translation, offering fresh, fierce and timely thinking on reading, writing and living with the works of others. Taking her own experience of translating Roland Barthes&#x2019;s lecture notes as a starting point, the author threads various stories together to give us this portrait of translation as a compelling, complex and intensely relational activity. She recounts the story of Helen Lowe-Porter&#x2019;s translations of Thomas Mann, and their posthumous vilification. She writes about the loving relationship between Andr� Gide and his translator Dorothy Bussy. She recalls how Robinson Crusoe laboriously made a table, for him for the first time, on an undeserted island. With <i>This Little Art</i>, a beautifully layered account of a subjective translating experience, Kate Briggs emerges as a truly remarkable writer: distinctive, wise, frank, funny and utterly original.</p><p>Kate Briggs is the translator of two volumes of Roland Barthes&#x2019;s lecture and seminar notes at the Coll�ge de France: <i>The Preparation of the Novel</i> and <i>How to Live Together</i>, both published by Columbia University Press.

Standing a small distance behind him, in the doorway of the little salon, is Frau Chauchat. She is dressed in a startling gown of thin, dark silk. <br> Was it black? Probably. <br> Or, at most, shot with golden brown. <br> Cut with a modest little neck, round like a school-girl&#x2019;s frock. Hardly so much as to show the base of her throat. Or the collar bones. Or, beneath the soft fringes of her hair, the slightly prominent bone at the back of her neck. <br> But all the while leaving bare to the shoulder her arms. <br> Arms so tender and so full. <br> So cool and so amazingly white, set off against the dark silk of her frock. <br> To such ravishing effect as to make Hans Castorp close his eyes. And murmur, deep within himself: &#x2018;O my God!&#x2019; <br> He had once held a theory about those arms. He had thought, on making their acquaintance for the first time &#x2013; veiled, as they had been then, in diaphanous gauze &#x2013; that their indescribable, unreasonable seductiveness was down to the gauze itself. To the &#x2018;illusion&#x2019;, as he had called it. Folly! The utter, accentuated, blinding nudity of those arms was an experience now so intoxicating, compared with that earlier one, as to leave our man no other recourse than once again, with drooping head, to whisper, soundlessly: &#x2018;O my God!&#x2019; <br></p><h2>He Wins, She Wins: Learning the Art of Marital Negotiation</h2><p>When you get married, you expect your relationship to be a partnership in which you make decisions and face the world together, united.

In this cave full of death and silence, a cry. </i></p> <p><i>A child. </i></p> <p><i>He turned, searching frantically for the source of the thready wail. It seemed to be coming from closer to the cave entrance. He plunged back the way he had come, stumbling over bodies, some frozen stiff as statues - until suddenly another familiar face stared up at him from the carnage. </i></p> <p><i>Declan. Sarah's brother, wounded in the last battle. He appeared to have been choked to death by a particularly cruel use of air magic; his face was blue, his eyes shot with broken blood vessels. One of his arms was outflung, and just underneath it, protected from the icy cave floor by a woven blanket, was Alastair's infant son. As he stared in amazement, the boy opened his mouth and gave another thin, mewling cry. </i></p> <p><i>As if in trance, shaking with relief, Alistair bent and lifted his child. The boy looked up at him with wide gray eyes and opened his mouth to scream again. As the blanket fell aside, Alastair could see why. The baby's left leg hung at a terrible angle, like a snapped tree branch. </i></p> <p><i>Alastair tried to call up earth magic to heal the boy, but only had enough power left to take away some of the pain. Heart racing, he rewrapped his son tightly in the blanket and wound his way back through the cave to where Sarah lay. Holding the baby as if she could see him, he knelt down beside her body. </i></p> <p><i>"Sarah," he whispered, tears thick in his throat. "I'll tell him how you died protecting him. I will raise him to remember how brave you were." </i></p> <p><i>Her eyes stared at him, blank and pale. He held the child more closely to his side and reached to take Semiramis from her hand. As he did, he saw that the ice near the blade was strangely marked, as if she had clawed at it while dying. But the marks were too deliberate for that. As he bent closer, he realized that they were words - words his wife had carved into the cave ice with the last of her dying strength. As he read them, he felt them like three hard blows to the stomach. </i></p> <p><i>KILL THE CHILD.</i></p></p><h2>New Testament History</h2><p>This book recounts the Roman and Jewish context of New Testament times...the lives of John and Jesus, and the history of the first two generations of the Church.</p><p>"The best available treatment by an evangelical Christian.

Convinced he is right, my mind devoured this book. Often in the reading of these pages I forgot this was a book about worship and became lost in the very act of worship. Wiersbe wakes us to the wonder of God. A solid and scholarly challenge threads substance throughout the piece -- <i>Calvin Miller</i><br><br>(For the first edition) Rarely have I identified with an author in his perception and experience of worship as I have in this present volume. The reader will never be quite the same again after perusing these pages. He may not agree with everything, but he will have to acknowledge that mans chief end is to glorify God and to worship Him in the beauty of holiness -- <i>Stephen Olford</i><br><br>(For the first edition) Warren Wiersbe has done a masterful job of communicating our call to worship from the pages of Holy Scripture. His chapter on preaching as a sacrament is alone worth the price of the book. This is yet another prophetic voice calling modern evangelicalism back home to the priority of worship -- <i>Rt. Rev.

He argues that most pioneers were not young and that their families weren't much larger than present-day households. In addition, he states that adults lived longer than has been believed and that most early settlers were artisans and craftsmen with little knowledge of farming, although the wilderness soon forced them to adapt. Hawke includes entertaining discussions of what the first white Americans ate (for example, raccoon was served in New York). He also discusses how colonial Americans were punished for crimes and how they treated enslaved blacks and indentured servants.

What does it mean to give shapelessness a form? How can a poem explore both the natural world and the inner world? Phillips demonstrates the restless qualities of the imagination by reading and examining poems by Ashbery, Bogan, Frost, Niedecker, Shakespeare, and others, and by considering other art forms, such as photography and the blues. <i>The Art of Daring</i> is a lyrical, persuasive argument for the many ways that writing and living are acts of risk. "I think it's largely the conundrum of being human that makes us keep making," Phillips writes. "I think it has something to do with revision&#x2015;how, not only is the world in constant revision, but each of us is, as well."</p></p><p><p><b>Carl Phillips</b> is the author of a dozen books of poetry, including <i>Silverchest</i> and<i> Double Shadow</i>, and a collection of essays, <i>Coin of the Realm: Essays on the Art and Life of Poetry</i>.

Unfolding through a series of letters written by an unnamed narrator, <i>Last Words</i> tells the story of a passionate relationship between two young women&#x2014;their sexual awakening, their gradual breakup, and the devastating aftermath of their broken love. In a style that veers between extremes, from self-deprecation to pathos, compulsive repetition to rhapsodic musings, reticence to vulnerability, Qiu&#x2019;s genre-bending novel is at once a psychological thriller, a sublime romance, and the author&#x2019;s own suicide note.<br><br>The letters (which, Qiu tells us, can be read in any order) leap between Paris, Taipei, and Tokyo. They display wrenching insights into what it means to live between cultures, languages, and genders&#x2014;until the genderless character Zo� appears, and the narrator&#x2019;s spiritual and physical identity is transformed. As powerfully raw and transcendent as Mishima&#x2019;s <i>Confessions of a Mask</i>, Goethe&#x2019;s <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i>, and Theresa Cha&#x2019;s <i>Dict�e</i>, to name but a few,<i> Last Words from Montmartre</i> proves Qiu Miaojin to be one of the finest experimentalists and modernist Chinese-language writers of our generation.</p><p><b>Qiu Miaojin</b> (1969&#x2013;1995)&#x2014;one of Taiwan&#x2019;s most innovative literary modernists, and the country&#x2019;s most renowned lesbian writer&#x2014;was born in Chuanghua County in western Taiwan. She graduated with a degree in psychology from National Taiwan University and pursued graduate studies in clinical psychology at the University of Paris VIII . Her first published story, &#x201c;Prisoner,&#x201d; received the <i>Central Daily News </i>Short Story Prize, and her novella<i> Lonely Crowds</i> won the United Literature Association Award. While in Paris, she directed a thirty-minute film called <i>Ghost Carnival</i>, and not long after this, at the age of twenty-six, she committed suicide. The posthumous publications of her novels <i>Last Words from Montmartre</i> and <i>Notes of a Crocodile</i> (forthcoming from NYRB Classics) made her into one of the most revered countercultural icons in Chinese letters. After her death in 1995, she was given the China Times Honorary Prize for Literature. In 2007, a two-volume edition of her <i>Diaries</i> was published.<br><br><b>Ari Larissa Heinrich</b> received a master&#x2019;s in Chinese literature from Harvard and a PhD in Chinese studies from the University of California at Berkeley.

He is the author of <i>The Afterlife of Images: Translating the Pathological Body Between China and the West</i> and the coeditor of<i> Queer Sinophone Cultures</i>. He teaches at the University of California at San Diego."I&#x2019;d put&nbsp;<i>Last Words</i>&nbsp;in a category that includes much of Kathy Acker and Henry Miller.

Qiu&#x2019;s prose strikes the reader like a tsunami: waters of an unassuming height slowly but assuredly surge onto the land until they fill every room and take every object not nailed down. This is not simply passion, but what the Chinese call qing, which is passion as a full-blown aesthetic ideology. For those overcome by it, qing becomes the sine qua non of existing in the world. To quote the preface of the sixteenth-century play <i>The Peony Pavilion</i>, qing can cause &#x201c;the living to die, and the dead to live again.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;Dylan Suher, <i>Asymptote<br></i><br>&#x201c;Echoing W.

To his surprise, the eccentric Christopher Wilde turns out to be a naturalist, explorer, inventor, and abolitionist. Soon Wash is initiated into a world where a flying machine can carry a man across the sky, where even a boy born in chains may embrace a life of dignity and meaning--and where two people, separated by an impossible divide, can begin to see each other as human. But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash's head, Christopher and Wash must abandon everything. What follows is their flight along the eastern coast of America, and, finally, to a remote outpost in the Arctic. What brings Christopher and Wash together will tear them apart, propelling Wash even further across the globe in search of his true self. From the blistering cane fields of the Caribbean to the frozen Far North, from the earliest aquariums of London to the eerie deserts of Morocco, <i>Washington Black</i> tells a story of self-invention and betrayal, of love and redemption, of a world destroyed and made whole again, and asks the question, What is true freedom?</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of September 2018:</strong>: <em>Washington Black</em> is that rarest of novels: a hybrid that knows exactly what it is. The story begins as an antebellum novel about Wash, an 11-year-old slave working on a Barbados plantation run by a sadistic master. When Christopher, the master&#x2019;s brother, takes Wash under his wing and teaches him to read, the novel turns more toward adventure and scientific exploration. There are inventions, twists, and turns; there is danger and intrigue; there is travel and growth. What holds everything together is author Esi Edugyan&#x2019;s writing chops.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents&#x2019; indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa&#x2019;s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.</p><p><i>Born a Crime</i> is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man&#x2019;s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother&#x2014;his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.</p><p>The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother&#x2019;s unconventional, unconditional love.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Born a Crime</i></b></p><p> &#x201c;[A] compelling new memoir . . .

The person hits the ground and rolls for a bit. Then they come to a stop and pop up and dust themselves off, like it was no big deal. Whenever I see that I think, That&#x2019;s rubbish. Getting thrown out of a moving car hurts way worse than that.<br><br>I was nine years old when my mother threw me out of a moving car. It happened on a Sunday. I know it was on a Sunday because we were coming home from church, and every Sunday in my childhood meant church. We never missed church. My mother was&#x2014;�and still is&#x2014;� a deeply religious woman. Very Christian. Like indigenous peoples around the world, black South Africans adopted the religion of our colonizers. By &#x201c;adopt&#x201d; I mean it was forced on us. The white man was quite stern with the native. &#x201c;You need to pray to Jesus,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Jesus will save you.&#x201d; To which the native replied, &#x201c;Well, we do need to be saved&#x2014;�saved from you, but that&#x2019;s beside the point. So let&#x2019;s give this Jesus thing a shot.&#x201d;<br><br>My whole family is religious, but where my mother was Team Jesus all the way, my grandmother balanced her Christian faith with the traditional Xhosa beliefs she&#x2019;d grown up with, communicating with the spirits of our ancestors. For a long time I didn&#x2019;t understand why so many black people had abandoned their indigenous faith for Christianity. But the more we went to church and the longer I sat in those pews the more I learned about how Christianity works: If you&#x2019;re Native American and you pray to the wolves, you&#x2019;re a savage. If you&#x2019;re African and you pray to your ancestors, you&#x2019;re a primitive. But when white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine, well, that&#x2019;s just common sense.<br><br>My childhood involved church, or some form of church, at least four nights a week. Tuesday night was the prayer meeting. Wednesday night was Bible study. Thursday night was Youth church. Friday and Saturday we had off. (Time to sin!) Then on Sunday we went to church. Three churches, to be precise. The reason we went to three churches was because my mom said each church gave her something different. The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord. The second church offered deep analysis of the scripture, which my mom loved. The third church offered passion and catharsis; it was a place where you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit inside you. Completely by coincidence, as we moved back and forth among these churches, I noticed that each one had its own distinct racial makeup: Jubilant church was mixed church. Analytical church was white church. And passionate, cathartic church, that was black church.<br><br>Mixed church was Rhema Bible Church. Rhema was one of those huge, super�modern, suburban megachurches. The pastor, Ray McCauley, was an ex-bodybuilder with a big smile and the personality of a cheerleader. Pastor Ray had competed in the 1974 Mr. Universe competition. He placed third. The winner that year was Arnold Schwarzenegger. Every week, Ray would be up onstage working really hard to make Jesus cool. There was arena-�style seating and a rock band jamming out with the latest Christian contemporary pop. Everyone sang along, and if you didn&#x2019;t know the words that was okay because they were all right up there on the Jumbotron for you. It was Christian karaoke, basically. I always had a blast at mixed church.<br><br>White church was Rosebank Union in Sandton, a very white and wealthy part of Johannesburg. I loved white church because I didn&#x2019;t actually have to go to the main service. My mom would go to that, and I would go to the youth side, to Sunday school. In Sunday school we got to read cool stories. Noah and the flood was obviously a favorite; I had a personal stake there. But I also loved the stories about Moses parting the Red Sea, David slaying Goliath, Jesus whipping the money changers in the temple.<br><br>I grew up in a home with very little exposure to popular culture. Boyz II Men were not allowed in my mother&#x2019;s house. Songs about some guy grinding on a girl all night long? No, no, no. That was forbidden. I&#x2019;d hear the other kids at school singing &#x201c;End of the Road,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;d have no clue what was going on. I knew of these Boyz II Men, but I didn&#x2019;t really know who they were. The only music I knew was from church: soaring, uplifting songs praising Jesus. It was the same with movies. My mom didn&#x2019;t want my mind polluted by movies with sex and violence. So the Bible was my action movie. Samson was my superhero. He was my He-�Man. A guy beating a thousand people to death with the jawbone of a donkey? That&#x2019;s pretty badass. Eventually you get to Paul writing letters to the Ephesians and it loses the plot, but the Old Testament and the Gospels? I could quote you anything from those pages, chapter and verse. There were Bible games and quizzes every week at white church, and I kicked everyone&#x2019;s ass.<br><br>Then there was black church. There was always some kind of black church service going on somewhere, and we tried them all. In the township, that typically meant an outdoor, tent-�revival-�style church. We usually went to my grandmother&#x2019;s church, an old-�school Methodist congregation, five hundred African grannies in blue-�and-�white blouses, clutching their Bibles and patiently burning in the hot African sun. Black church was rough, I won&#x2019;t lie. No air-�conditioning. No lyrics up on Jumbotrons. And it lasted forever, three or four hours at least, which confused me because white church was only like an hour&#x2014;�in and out, thanks for coming. But at black church I would sit there for what felt like an eternity, trying to figure out why time moved so slowly. Is it possible for time to actually stop? If so, why does it stop at black church and not at white church? I eventually decided black people needed more time with Jesus because we suffered more. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to fill up on my blessings for the week,&#x201d; my mother used to say. The more time we spent at church, she reckoned, the more blessings we accrued, like a Starbucks Rewards Card.<br><br>Black church had one saving grace. If I could make it to the third or fourth hour I&#x2019;d get to watch the pastor cast demons out of people. People possessed by demons would start running up and down the aisles like madmen, screaming in tongues. The ushers would tackle them, like bouncers at a club, and hold them down for the pastor. The pastor would grab their heads and violently shake them back and forth, shouting, &#x201c;I cast out this spirit in the name of Jesus!&#x201d; Some pastors were more violent than others, but what they all shared in common was that they wouldn&#x2019;t stop until the demon was gone and the congregant had gone limp and collapsed on the stage. The person had to fall. Because if he didn&#x2019;t fall that meant the demon was powerful and the pastor needed to come at him even harder. You could be a linebacker in the NFL. Didn&#x2019;t matter. That pastor was taking you down. Good Lord, that was fun.<br><br>Christian karaoke, badass action stories, and violent faith healers&#x2014;�man, I loved church. The thing I didn&#x2019;t love was the lengths we had to go to in order to get to church. It was an epic slog. We lived in Eden Park, a tiny suburb way outside Johannesburg. It took us an hour to get to white church, another forty-�five minutes to get to mixed church, and another forty-�five minutes to drive out to Soweto for black church. Then, if that weren&#x2019;t bad enough, some Sundays we&#x2019;d double back to white church for a special evening service. By the time we finally got home at night, I&#x2019;d collapse into bed.<br><br>This particular Sunday, the Sunday I was hurled from a moving car, started out like any other Sunday. My mother woke me up, made me porridge for breakfast. I took my bath while she dressed my baby brother Andrew, who was nine months old. Then we went out to the driveway, but once we were finally all strapped in and ready to go, the car wouldn&#x2019;t start. My mom had this ancient, broken-�down, bright-�tangerine Volkswagen Beetle that she picked up for next to nothing. The reason she got it for next to nothing was because it was always breaking down. To this day I hate secondhand cars. Almost everything that&#x2019;s ever gone wrong in my life I can trace back to a secondhand car. Secondhand cars made me get detention for being late for school. Secondhand cars left us hitchhiking on the side of the freeway. A secondhand car was also the reason my mom got married. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for the Volkswagen that didn&#x2019;t work, we never would have looked for the mechanic who became the husband who became the stepfather who became the man who tortured us for years and put a bullet in the back of my mother&#x2019;s head&#x2014;�I&#x2019;ll take the new car with the warranty every time.<br><br>As much as I loved church, the idea of a nine-�hour slog, from mixed church to white church to black church then doubling back to white church again, was just too much to contemplate. It was bad enough in a car, but taking public transport would be twice as long and twice as hard. When the Volkswagen refused to start, inside my head I was praying, Please say we&#x2019;ll just stay home. Please say we&#x2019;ll just stay home. Then I glanced over to see the determined look on my mother&#x2019;s face, her jaw set, and I knew I had a long day ahead of me.<br><br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to catch minibuses.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother is as stubborn as she is religious. Once her mind&#x2019;s made up, that&#x2019;s it. Indeed, obstacles that would normally lead a person to change their plans, like a car breaking down, only made her more determined to forge ahead.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Devil,&#x201d; she said about the stalled car. &#x201c;The Devil doesn&#x2019;t want us to go to church. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve got to catch minibuses.&#x201d;<br><br>Whenever I found myself up against my mother&#x2019;s faith-�based obstinacy, I would try, as respectfully as possible, to counter with an opposing point of view.<br><br>&#x201c;Or,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;the Lord knows that today we shouldn&#x2019;t go to church, which is why he made sure the car wouldn&#x2019;t start, so that we stay at home as a family and take a day of rest, because even the Lord rested.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, that&#x2019;s the Devil talking, Trevor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, because Jesus is in control, and if Jesus is in control and we pray to Jesus, he would let the car start, but he hasn&#x2019;t, therefore&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Trevor! Sometimes Jesus puts obstacles in your way to see if you overcome them. Like Job. This could be a test.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah! Yes, Mom. But the test could be to see if we&#x2019;re willing to accept what has happened and stay at home and praise Jesus for his wisdom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. That&#x2019;s the Devil talking. Now go change your clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But Mom!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trevor! Sun&#x2019;qhela!&#x201d;<br><br>Sun&#x2019;qhela is a phrase with many shades of meaning. It says &#x201c;don&#x2019;t undermine me,&#x201d; &#x201c;don&#x2019;t underestimate me,&#x201d; and &#x201c;just try me.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a command and a threat, all at once. It&#x2019;s a common thing for Xhosa parents to say to their kids. Any time I heard it I knew it meant the conversation was over, and if I uttered another word I was in for a hiding&#x2014;�what we call a spanking.<br><br>At the time I attended a private Catholic school known as Maryvale College. I was the champion of the Maryvale sports day every single year, and my mother won the moms&#x2019; trophy every single year. Why? Because she was always chasing me to kick my ass, and I was always running not to get my ass kicked. Nobody ran like me and my mom. She wasn&#x2019;t one of those &#x201c;Come over here and get your hiding&#x201d; type moms. She&#x2019;d deliver it to you free of charge. She was a thrower, too. Whatever was next to her was coming at you. If it was something breakable, I had to catch it and put it down. If it broke, that would be my fault, too, and the ass-�kicking would be that much worse. If she threw a vase at me, I&#x2019;d have to catch it, put it down, and then run. In a split second, I&#x2019;d have to think, Is it valuable? Yes. Is it breakable? Yes. Catch it, put it down, now run.<br><br>We had a very Tom and Jerry relationship, me and my mom. She was the strict disciplinarian; I was naughty as shit. She would send me out to buy groceries, and I wouldn&#x2019;t come right home because I&#x2019;d be using the change from the milk and bread to play arcade games at the supermarket. I loved videogames. I was a master at Street Fighter. I could go forever on a single play. I&#x2019;d drop a coin in, time would fly, and the next thing I knew there&#x2019;d be a woman behind me with a belt. It was a race. I&#x2019;d take off out the door and through the dusty streets of Eden Park, clambering over walls, ducking through backyards. It was a normal thing in our neighborhood. Everybody knew: that Trevor child would come through like a bat out of hell, and his mom would be right there behind him. She could go at a full sprint in high heels, but if she really wanted to come after me she had this thing where she&#x2019;d kick her shoes off while still going at top speed. She&#x2019;d do this weird move with her ankles and the heels would go flying and she wouldn&#x2019;t even miss a step. That&#x2019;s when I knew, Okay, she&#x2019;s in turbo mode now.<br><br>When I was little she always caught me, but as I got older I got faster, and when speed failed her she&#x2019;d use her wits. If I was about to get away she&#x2019;d yell, &#x201c;Stop! Thief!&#x201d; She&#x2019;d do this to her own child. In South Africa, nobody gets involved in other people&#x2019;s business&#x2014;unless it&#x2019;s mob justice, and then everybody wants in. So she&#x2019;d yell &#x201c;Thief!&#x201d; knowing it would bring the whole neighborhood out against me, and then I&#x2019;d have strangers trying to grab me and tackle me, and I&#x2019;d have to duck and dive and dodge them as well, all the while screaming, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a thief! I&#x2019;m her son!&#x201d;<br><br>The last thing I wanted to do that Sunday morning was climb into some crowded minibus, but the second I heard my mom say sun&#x2019;qhela I knew my fate was sealed. She gathered up Andrew and we climbed out of the Volkswagen and went out to try to catch a ride.</p><h2>Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (The Samuel and Althea Stroum Lectures in Jewish Studies)</h2><p>"Mr. Yerushalmi's previous writings . . . established him as one of the Jewish community's most important historians.

He began cartooning in 2003, and has since won several awards, including the Jonathan Cape/Observer Graphic Short Story Prize and the inaugural 9th Art Award. His work has appeared in many publications worldwide, including <i>Wired</i>, <i>GQ</i>, and the BBC, and he contributes regular comics to the <i>Guardian Weekend</i> and <i>Prospect </i>magazine. He lives near Hertford with his wife and a well-charged beard trimmer.</p><p>&#x201c;Slyly exquisite...What happens over the course of the next 200+ pages is a dilemma Roald Dahl would have relished: The roiling anarchy of There erupts on Here--specifically, on poor Dave's previously clean-shaven cheeks--in the form of a great, snarly, twisting, unstoppable beard....If Collins is right--if, as he says, stories are necessary--then let's hope this wry young writer/artist has got a lot more lies to tell us.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Glen Weldon, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;I don't want to spoil it...[but] it's kind of Roald Dahl--it's very funny, dark, fable-like and about exactly what it's title says.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Linda Holmes, NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Gigantic Beard That Was Evil</i> has the tone of a playful fable, from the cracked syntax of its title onward...For a book about the liberating joys of disruption, though, it's exceptionally disciplined: Collins renders several hundred pages of immaculately ruled buildings and bean-faced people (and the fuzzy curlicues that interfere with them) in meticulous, microdetailed pencil textures.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>NewYorkTimes.com (Sunday Book Review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;With one hell of a title, Stephen Collins' graphic novel makes an immediate impression, and the interior contents are just as gripping as the name....It's a poignant parable about the value of individuality and going against the grain, presented with a charming art style that brings a smooth animated quality to the story without losing sight of the darker aspects of the plot.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The A.V.

The final moments of Dave's story are incredibly inspirational, and The Bangles' "Eternal Flame" has never been used as effectively as it is in those pages.

You can obsess over panel after carefully crosshatched panel for hours without feeling you've exhausted the book's possibilities.

Includes sprouting techniques, fermenting of vegetables, and menus for all day.</p><p><b>Ann Wigmore</b> dedicated her life to teaching others the health benefits of natural foods. She spent years experimenting to find simple, healthful, and inexpensive ways to grow and prepare nutrient-rich foods. Wigmore wrote more than 15 books, including <i>The Wheatgrass Book</i> and <i>Be Your Own Doctor</i>.<p></p><p>The medical and health procedures in this book are based on the training, personal experiences, and research of the author.

It is a sign of wisdom, not cowardice, to seek a second or third opinion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THE VITAMIN QUESTION</p><p>There has been more research work done on vitamins than any other component of food, and yet the basic facts of vitamins are almost lost upon both researchers and laymen.</p><p>It is necessary to recognize &#x201c;living forces&#x201d; as separate and apart from materialistic concepts. It is impossible to analyze or separate out vitamins. The vitamins are something immaterial &#x2014; a &#x201c;living force.&#x201d; Foods rich in vitamins, such as wheat grass or carrots, take on the &#x201c;living forces&#x201d; so that the &#x201c;living forces&#x201d; are integral with the wheat grass and carrots but cannot be separated from them. The &#x201c;living forces&#x201d; may be lost but cannot be separated out.</p><p>What is the main source of this &#x201c;living force&#x201d;? The main source is the sun. We think of the sun&#x2019;s rays as light rays, but in reality many different types of rays come into the world from the sun, and these are not all visible to us. The infrared rays and ultraviolet rays are examples.</p><p>Foods rich in vitamin A, such as oils and seeds, are those which are rich in &#x201c;warmth.&#x201d; Warmth derives from the sun &#x2014; mostly from the infrared rays of the sun.</p><p>Foods rich in vitamin B are those rich in &#x201c;order&#x201d; such as the husks of wheat berries or rice and the peels of fruit. Order derives from the ultraviolet rays of the sun.</p><p>Foods rich in vitamin C are those rich in &#x201c;light&#x201d; such as green leaves (wheat grass). Light derives from the visible rays of the sun.</p><p>Vitamin D is in another category. The best way to describe vitamin D is to relate an experiment with pigeons which had the oil glands under their tails removed. They developed rickets, the prime vitamin D deficiency disease. When preening their feathers, the pigeons could no longer oil their feathers to allow the sun to irradiate the oil into vitamin D, with resultant absorption of the irradiated oil into the birds&#x2019; skins. Undoubtedly our best vitamin D is the vitamin D we ourselves can properly absorb through our skin from the rays of the sun. My personal belief and practice is to expose a reasonable amount of my skin to the sun whenever conveniently possible.</p><p>Paradoxically, the warmth, light, and air which impart the &#x201c;living forces&#x201d; to growing foods will destroy them after they have been harvested. Take hay, for example, which is livestock&#x2019;s chief sources of complete vitamins. A farmer will store his hay, protecting it as much as possible from light, heat, and moving air current. Years ago there were dairies which bottled milk in amber-colored bottles to protect the milk from light. The milk was to be kept refrigerated and sealed except when poured for use. The same principles apply to all &#x201c;living food,&#x201d; once harvested. The food should be protected as much as possible from warmth, light, and air.</p><p>Harvey C. Lisle</p><p>A WORD FROM HARVEY G. LISLE TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO ANN WIGMORE</p><p>I graduated in 1937 from Ohio State University, where I had majored in chemistry. After getting out of the U.S. Air Force, I worked as a chemist for an agricultural laboratory (the Brookside Laboratory) where I tested soils and animal fodder, and subsequently I worked as a food technologist. At the same time, I took up my avocation of testing food for human consumption.</p><p>My chief diagnostic tool for testing foodstuffs is &#x201c;paper chromotography.&#x201d; Paper chromatograms are mediums for telling whether or not a food has been raised organically/naturally; whether it is full of life forces or devoid of such forces. While this testing method gives only basic answers, these are basic answers essential to a &#x201c;grass roots movement&#x201d; of people interested in a more natural lifestyle.</p><p>Ann Wigmore, with her lay organization, the Hippocrates Health Institute, is a prime example of a person needing help ordinarily unavailable from any professional source. I agreed to help her in those areas where I felt qualified. Such help has always been rendered out of love for humanity and not out of love for remuneration.</p><p>One of the keys to Ann Wigmore&#x2019;s program is the raising of wheatgrass and the consumption of wheatgrass chlorophyll. The growing of wheatgrass is relatively simple and can be carried out by anyone who desires to do so, regardless of whether at Ann Wigmore&#x2019;s Mansion, at home, in a desert region, or even on travels. Although raising wheatgrass is simple, there are a few fundamental rules which must be followed if the grass is to be of value. With the help of my experience and testing methods, we were able to devise with Dr. Ann what we think is the optimum method for raising the kind of wheatgrass which incorporates the highest grade of chlorophyll, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes.</p><p>The next step was to determine whether the fresh wheatgrass juice should be drunk immediately or whether it could be made in advance and then stored in the refrigerator for a few hours or any other length of time. Although we had a good idea of what the answer would be, it took a little research to arrive at a fairly definite time span. The answer was as follows: for the maximum benefit, the freshly-extracted juice must be consumed within fifteen minutes of its preparation. Research done by other scientists on a variety of juices (including wheatgrass juice) shows that a median time lapse of only seven minutes is recommended for full benefits. We are all, therefore, in full agreement that a freshly-extracted juice of fresh living produce must be drunk almost immediately.</p><p>Ann Wigmore asked me to formulate a salad that would be complete in food values, including proteins. This research involved not laboratory facilities, but books and tables which gave such diverse information as amino acid values, calories, percentage of fat or carbohydrates, life energy (resistance), etc. Such a salad was formulated with the provision that if a person was still hungry or had a craving after eating, that person was allowed to satisfy his/her appetite by supplementation with other vegetarian food.</p><p>There were a number of what I would call minor problems which Dr. Ann asked me to address. For example, almost everyone likes watermelons, but almost no one eats the white meat of the inner rind which borders the red fruit. Analysis proved the white portion to be very rich in nutrients. Tests on family and friends confirmed that the white meat is very easily digestible &#x2014; so the conclusion is obvious. The taste of the white meat is not objectionable; the only consideration is that this portion is harder to chew than the inner red fruit. Therefore, for the sake of health and the strengthening of much-needed will power, go ahead and eat it for all-around benefit. As is widely known today, the minerals and vitamins, as well as the enzymes, of all fruits and vegetables are located predominantly in rinds and skins and immediately underneath them.</p><p>Another major key to Dr. Ann Wigmore&#x2019;s Health Program is enzyme-rich fermented foods: seed sauces and cheeses and a drink called Rejuvelac. She never told me how she came to develop this most beneficial beverage, but she told me how it is made and asked me to find out all I could about it. I found that Rejuvelac shows immediate good results. It is simply a drink of fermented cereal grains. Fermentation of grains creates a high enzymatic activity, which is the basic essential of Rejuvelac. Human digestion is dependent upon enzymatic activity, so those people in ill health or with poor digestion benefit especially from drinking this very slightly sour liquid.</p><p>While Dr. Ann Wigmore&#x2019;s main thrust is restoration of good health for those who lack it (especially those afflicted with grave and painful malfunctions like cancer), she has other allied interests. One of these is the health of our pets. Another is the improvement of school lunches.</p><p>This pretty much concludes the majority of projects we have carried out for Dr. Ann Wigmore. It is my conviction that healing is still more of an art than a science. Ann Wigmore has the background, conviction, and talents to carry out her healing program successfully. I am pleased that I could add my small talents to help her along her chosen path.<br></p><p>Harvey Lisle</p><p>Norwalk, Ohio - September, 1980</p><p>PROFILE OF DR. ANN WIGMORE</p><p>Dr. Ann founded the Hippocrates Health Institute in Boston to share her Living Food Program with the world. It is the home base of the Hippocrates World Health Organization, founded by Dr. Ann in 1970 and which is now growing rapidly with centers in Michigan and Bombay, India. The HWHO is an educational, humanitarian, non-profit organization devoted to the physical, mental, and spiritual development of mankind through a living, uncooked, diet. Students come from all over the world to learn the Living Food Program, and return home equipped to teach to others the techniques they have learned. With its emphasis on sprouting, fermenting, composting, and living food, there is no other program like it in the world.</p><p>Ann has repeatedly shown that the body <i>will heal</i> itself of any illness when it is given Living Food Nourishment. Sprouts, wheatgrass, seeds, grains, indoor greens, fermented sauces and uncooked fruits and vegetables &#x2014; that is, all living foods which are easily digestible and wonderfully nutritious &#x2014; form the staple of her Living Food Program. These living foods have been shown by Dr. Ann to provide the body with everything it needs for optimum health, harmony, and vitality.</p><p>During her long and loving service to humanity (twenty-seven years), she has received numerous honors and awards for her outstanding work in the field of health and human nutrition. In 1971, The Nobel Prize Foundation (Royal Laplander Academy of Science) in Europe presented her with a Recognition Award for work in the Field of Youthfulness and for Efforts in Regeneration of Human Cells and Tissues; in 1978, Dr. Ann was made <i>Lady Ann Wigmore</i> by the Kingdom of the Netherlands which presented her with its highest award, the Order of Chivalry, for &#x201c;distinguished achievement and noble deeds&#x201d; in recognition of her outstanding work in the field of health and human ecology. In 1979, she was presented with a Cancer Victory Award by the Arlin J. Brown Information Center &#x201c;in appreciation for saving numerous lives... .&#x201d;</p><p>As far back as 1975, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had awarded her with a citation for &#x201c;exemplary development of food self-sufficiency through the wise use of natural resources.&#x201d; Dr. Ann had donated five years of teaching workshops in the Boston area to high schools and colleges. These workshops on sprouting, healing, and soil composting are very popular. She co-lectured for many years with her friend and colleage, Dr. Paul Dudley White, the famous heart specialist.</p><p>Ann has traveled extensively around the world promoting her Living Food Program. Between 1977 and 1979, she traveled to India three times. There she opened seven health restoration camps, lectured at the Medical Research Hospital, and opened a HWHO center in Bombay. There, as in America, thousands of ailing people were helped to health by her program of living food, sprouting, and colon cleansing. While in India, Dr. Ann also published four books, among them <i>You Are Your Own Healer.</i></p><p>During August of 1980, Dr. Ann spent ten days in Finland where she was warmly received. While there, she generated considerable excitement because of her program; as a result, a number of significant events are now happening. Her books are going to be translated into Finnish, among many other languages.</p><p>As more and more people become educated about living foods and made aware of Nature&#x2019;s laws, they will begin to experience the power and grace behind Hippocrates&#x2019; words, &#x201c;Let food be thy medicine.&#x201d;</p><p>To human angels everywhere who have become aware that living food is the key not only to health and reduction of living costs in these times of inflation, but also helpful in reducing the consumption of energy and, more important, reducing the time needed to prepare meals. Instead of spending three hours over the stove cooking and destroying the life force in foods, one need spend a maximum of only one hour to prepare the nourishment that God created. This living food cookbook is also a means of survival and will provide guidelines for the prevention and overcoming of sickness and old age.</p><p>These souls that have become human angels have taken it upon themselves to be examples. I would like to comment on their courage &#x2014; their courage to move into the change despite resistance encountered from their family and friends &#x2014; and perhaps from society. I dedicate this book to them because of their fortitude and faith in Nature and God; their awakening desire to help themselves and their families and friends (when they become ready to be helped); their interest in helping humanity as a whole.</p><p>It has been a great privilege for me to work with these human angels and to watch them grow and improve, not only physically and mentally, but also spiritually, as they move into this New Age, through Nature&#x2019;s and God&#x2019;s way &#x2014; by living food. So I want to say that these people deserve my dedication as an encouragement to them to continue to join my long-standing efforts to make a better world, the results of which I begin to see manifested everywhere.</p><p>Again, let me say &#x2014; with my heart full of gratitude and love, and my dedication &#x2014; that we will proceed until we have changed the whole of humanity and its attitude toward caring, especially caring for Nature, for one&#x2019;s body, for one&#x2019;s pets, for all of creation which humankind has so unknowingly neglected. For your love through service, I say, thank you, thank you.<br><br></p><p>Ann Wigmore, D.D., N.D.</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>The idea for the Recipe Book grew from a desire to share with others the knowledge of how easily raw food meals are prepared, how delicious they are, and how readily they can fit into any diet &#x2014; no matter what else that diet may include. This new edition appears at a time when there is great general interest in health. Those of you who share this interest will realize that by preparing these meals, you are promoting your health and that of your families &#x2014; for all the ingredients proposed are those belonging to Mother Nature herself.</p><p>Dr. Ann Wigmore&#x2019;s program of living foods has brought me great benefits and I&#x2019;d like to help bring those benefits to...</p></p><h2>Last Dance, Last Chance (8) (Ann Rule&#39;s Crime Files)</h2><p>"America's best true-crime writer" <i>(Kirkus Reviews),</i> Ann Rule presents an all-new collection of crime stories drawn from her private files -- and featuring the riveting case of a fraudulent doctor whose lifelong deceptions had deadly consequences. <br> <b>LAST DANCE LAST CHANCE</b> <br> Dr. Anthony Pignataro was a cosmetic surgeon and a famed medical researcher whose flashy red Lamborghini and flamboyant lifestyle in western New York State suggested a highly successful career. But appearances, as this shocking insider account of Pignataro's tailspin from physician to prisoner proves, can be deceiving -- and, for the doctor's wife, very nearly deadly. No one was safe if they got in his way. With scalpel, drugs, and arsenic, he betrayed every oath a physician makes -- until his own schemes backfired. Now, the motivations of the classic sociopath are plumbed with chilling accuracy by Ann Rule. Along with other shocking true cases, this worldwide headline-making case will have you turning pages in disbelief that a trusted medical professional could sink to the depths of greed, manipulation, and self-aggrandizement where even slow, deliberate murder is not seen for what it truly is: pure evil.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><i>It was so hot, and the air was heavy and muggy with humidity. Even rain didn't cleanse the air; it only became thicker and harder to breathe. The woman who lay on the couch had been sick for so long that she couldn't remember feeling well. Sometime earlier -- last week or maybe last month -- she had been able to walk. But now her feet and legs had become leaden stumps, unwilling to accept any messages from her brain.</i><br><br>Her brain wasn't working very well, either. She knew she was still living in her old familiar neighborhood, but it all looked as if it were underwater or as if someone had painted it a different color. She remembered that when she could still navigate, the street signs were wavy and jarring, and she got lost. She remembered vaguely that she had walked into a neighbor's kitchen, a neighbor she barely knew. She didn't know why she was there, and the woman who lived there certainly didn't either. It was embarrassing to be led home.<br><br>When she looked into a mirror, her own face looked alien to her. It was all bloated and puffy, with black circles carved beneath her dark eyes. She looked a hundred years old, but she couldn't remember growing old. She couldn't remember when she got sick.<br><br>Sometimes people came and went, and her friends' faces seemed to float above her, their expressions worried and concerned.<br><br><i>How do you feel?</i> they asked, but she couldn't answer them. She couldn't describe how she felt. Sick. Sick. <i>Sick.</i> And so tired that she could not imagine cooking a meal or making a bed or walking to the mailbox ever again. When she could fix her mind on her children, she wept inside for them. They no longer had a mother, only a useless, swollen blob who sat propped up in a recliner chair while the world went on without her.<br><br>The doctors didn't seem to know what to do about her. The one man she trusted most assured everyone that she was doing just fine, and that he would take care of her. Sometimes he said that all she needed was to have her gall bladder removed. He didn't think there was anything really wrong with her. And he, of all people, would surely know.<br><br>But nothing changed. She sat in her chair for what seemed like months. He lay on the couch nearby, rarely leaving her alone. Sometimes it seemed to her that he was watching over her with concern, and sometimes he didn't seem to notice her any more than if she were a piece of furniture. The ice clinked in his drink as he watched television, clicking the channel changer often. His voice slurred, and he dozed off, but he never did anything, despite the questions people kept asking him.<br><br><i>Why don't you take her to the hospital?</i> they asked him.<br><br><i>They have a skeleton staff on the weekends,</i> he told them. <i>She's much better off here with me...</i><br><br>And so, day after day, the sun came up with pale washed skies, grew bright and hot at noon, and faded until the room was again in shadow. And Debbie Pignataro was still there.<br><br>At length, with what rational thought she could manage, she began to believe that she would die there, surrounded by people who loved her -- people whom she loved -- and yet somehow beyond all hope of rescue.<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Ann Rule</p><h2>Milk Glass Moon (Big Stone Gap)</h2><p><b>Milk Glass Moon</b>, the third book in Adriana Trigiani's bestselling Big Stone Gap series, continues the life story of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney as she faces the challenges and changes of motherhood with her trademark humor and honesty.

In this fallen world, people are hurt and exploited. Children are abused. Marriages are broken. Tragedies of all kinds afflict us and the ones we love. Woundedness, it seems, is simply a fact of life. But we are not alone in our suffering. Despite our emotional, psychological and physical injuries, God has not abandoned us. God is not distant or aloof. On the contrary, through the ministry of Jesus, God enters our painful situations to bring healing and redemption. Balancing sound biblical exposition with sensitive pastoral care, Stephen Seamands examines the profound implications of Jesus' crucifixion for our healing and restoration. Because Jesus experienced abuse, shame and rejection, he understands the hurts we experience today. And his response to pain and suffering gives us hope that we too can experience forgiveness and new life. Filled with real-life stories of people?s brokenness and healing, <em>Wounds That Heal</em> offers comfort for our wounded souls. Ultimately, we take heart that God not only understands our pain but has done something about it. Encounter here the promise that the wounds of Jesus are wounds that heal.</p><p>Stephen Seamands (Ph.D., Drew University) is professor of Christian doctrine at Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Kentucky. He also frequently speaks and leads retreats and seminars on such issues as emotional healing and spiritual renewal. His books include <em>Christology and Transition in the Theology of Edwin Lewis</em> (University Press of America, 1987), <em>Holiness of Heart and Life</em> (Abingdon, 1990), <em>A Conversation with Jesus</em> (Victor, 1994) and <em>Wounds That Heal</em> (InterVarsity Press, 2003).</p><h2>The Secret (Seasons of Grace, Book 1)</h2><p>In the seemingly ordinary Amish home of Grace Byler, secrets abound. Why does her mother weep in the night? Why does her father refuse to admit something is dreadfully wrong? Then, in one startling moment, everything Grace assumed she knew is shattered. Her mother's disappearance leaves Grace reeling and unable to keep her betrothal promise to her long-time beau. Left to pick up the pieces of her life, Grace questions all she has been taught about love, family, and commitment. <br><br>Heather Nelson is an English grad student, stunned by a doctor's diagnosis. Surely fate would not allow her father to lose his only daughter after the death of his wife a few years before. In denial and telling no one she is terminally ill, Heather travels to Lancaster County--the last place she and her mother had visited together. Will Heather find healing for body and spirit?<br><br> As the lives of four wounded souls begin to weave together like an Amish patchwork quilt, they each discover missing pieces of their life puzzles--and glimpse the merciful and loving hand of God.</p><p>Beverly Lewis, raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, is a former schoolteacher, an accomplished musician, and an award-winning author of more than eighty books, many of which have appeared on bestseller lists, including USA Today and The New York Times.

Xuela Claudette Richardson, the daughter of a Carib mother and a half-Scottish, half-African father, loses her mother to death the moment she is born and must find her way on her own.<br> Kincaid takes us from Xuela's childhood in a home where she can hear the song of the sea to the tin-roofed room where she lives as a schoolgirl in the house of Jack LaBatte, who becomes her first lover. Xuela develops a passion for the stevedore Roland, who steals bolts of Irish linen for her from the ships he unloads, but she eventually marries an English doctor, Philip Bailey. Xuela's is an intensely physical world, redolent of overripe fruit, gentian violet, sulfur, and rain on the road, and it seethes with her sorrow, her deep sympathy for those who share her history, her fear of her father, her desperate loneliness. But underlying all is "the black room of the world" that is Xuela's barrenness and motherlessness. <br> <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i> is a story of love, fear, loss, and the forging of character, an account of one woman's inexorable evolution, evoked in startling and magical poetry.</p></p><p>&#34;My mother died at the moment I was born, and so for my whole life there was nothing standing between myself and eternity,&#34; writes Jamaica Kincaid in this disturbing, compelling novel set on the island of Dominica. Born to a doomed Carib woman and a Scottish African policeman of increasing swagger and wealth, narrator Xuela spends a lifetime unanchored by family or love. She disdains the web of small and big lies that link others, allowing only pungent, earthy sensuality--a mix of blood and dirt and sex--to move her. Even answering its siren call, though, Xuela never loses sight of the sharp loss that launched her into the world and the doors through which she will take her leave.<p><b>Jamaica Kincaid</b> was born in St. John's, Antigua.

I honed the exercises in this book while preparing nearly a thousand trainees for the extreme demands of the most elite levels of the United States Special Operations community. Now the military&#x2019;s most advanced forces&#x2014;from SEALs to Green Berets&#x2014;use these movements.<br> &nbsp;<br> This is not &#x201c;boot camp&#x201d; run by some gym instructor in spandex who&#x2019;s never laced up a pair of combat boots. This is the world&#x2019;s most effective and efficient workout program from someone whose day job is to physically train troops who&#x2019;ve worn their boots through countless miles of mud, sand, and snow. Cool high-tech gear and weapons aside, the things that most determine a soldier&#x2019;s survival and victory are physical fitness and resolve: my areas of expertise.<br> &nbsp;<br> My first book, You Are Your Own Gym, owes its continued success among popular fitness books to teaching people to exercise alone, anywhere, anytime. I&#x2019;ve heard from countless readers who tell me that they have followed my program and now look and feel the best they ever have in their lives. While this feedback is extremely uplifting, gratifying, and personally inspiring, it&#x2019;s also not much of a surprise, considering I&#x2019;ve already seen the effects on the hundreds of troops I&#x2019;ve trained.<br> &nbsp;<br> You Are Your Own Gym remains the &#x201c;bible of bodyweight exercises.&#x201d; Through its 125 exercises, comprehensive training tools, and workout routines, it has helped sculpt the physiques of tens of thousands of people. While many women have told me of their great success with You Are Your Own Gym, I&#x2019;ve also heard that it didn&#x2019;t always meet a woman&#x2019;s needs and concerns&#x2014;from having less time to work out to wanting to address different physical goals. I tailored Body by You to those needs. Some of the movements I share in this book are new, and some are updated or adapted from exercises in You Are Your Own Gym. Taken as a whole, these exercises will guide you from where you are now to where you want to be, to look and feel the best you ever have in your life. You&#x2019;ll find that the workout never stays the same for long and the results&#x2014;toned arms, flatter abs, tighter buns, leaner legs, and curves in all the right places&#x2014;just keep on coming. I&#x2019;m not going to show you how to &#x201c;lose&#x201d; the fat on your belly or thighs. I&#x2019;m going to show you how to&#x2014;as we say in the military&#x2014;&#x201c;engage it for permanent termination.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s state the obvious: Women and men are different in lots of different ways. But the reality is that women&#x2019;s muscles are made up of the same fibers as men&#x2019;s. Our fat cells are identical. Our hormonal differences are what raise an interesting issue. Male testosterone levels make large muscles possible. Without the same high levels, women can&#x2019;t bulk up in the same way as men&#x2014;so stop worrying about that. What you will get out of my method is a solid foundation of strength, the kind of strength that leads to a lean physique and powerful athleticism. You will find the natural athlete that lies at your core. Feel the pride and joy in challenging yourself to rise beyond your own expectations and the peace and strength and beauty that come from it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Physical ability represents not only your mastery of the world around you but also of yourself. An essential source of self-confidence is pride and control over a finely tuned body. Follow my program and you won&#x2019;t ever have to run to anyone else for help because you&#x2019;re not strong enough or don&#x2019;t have the endurance. You&#x2019;ll be fit enough not only to cope with anything you want but to enjoy anything you want. You won&#x2019;t have to think if you can do something, only if you want to do something.<br> &nbsp;<br> I like to say that you are the only piece of exercise &#x201c;equipment&#x201d; you will ever need to be in the best shape of your life. You now hold in your hands the only user&#x2019;s manual for that equipment you will ever need. Face it: For thousands of years, humanity&#x2019;s greatest female physical specimens&#x2014;from ancient Greece&#x2019;s female athletes to tomorrow&#x2019;s G.I. Janes&#x2014;have not relied on Gold&#x2019;s Gyms or weights in their basements. Male or female, the human body doesn&#x2019;t require machines and dumbbells (or cardio!) in order to stay fit. Free yourself from the dependency on gadgets, trainers, and common misconceptions. They are all crutches, keeping you from getting into the best shape possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book will not teach you to move through the gym with ease. It will teach you to move through life with ease. You will learn to use the body you have to build the body you want. With just a small commitment of time&#x2014;without having to go to and from a gym&#x2014;you can fit this program into even your busiest schedule. The effort and time you put into my program will not be great, but the benefits you get out of it will be.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book is about you. You are the boss now. Your destiny is controlled by you. Not by your gym. Not by complicated fitness equipment. Not by dumbbells. Not by benches and bouncy balls and treadmills and yoga mats and infomercial contraptions. Not by some trainer. Not by your friends. Just by you.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s about you being leaner, stronger, more confident and energetic. You having the best body you can. You getting these results faster than ever before. And sustaining them as long as you live.<br> &nbsp;<br> I offer you all body: a flatter stomach, tighter thighs and glutes, more-toned arms, sculpted shoulders, stronger pecs to give your bosom a boost, a back that turns heads when you wear an evening dress, legs that look great in a pair of shorts. Everyone around you, both men and other women, will notice the changes in your body. You will look as strong on the outside as you feel on the inside.<br> &nbsp;<br> I offer you no bulk: No filler. No flab. No gab. No bloated chapters with unnecessary chatter. I offer you only what you&#x2019;ll need to look and feel as good as possible. I want to free up the rest of your time to do more of whatever you enjoy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Looking good is not some mysterious, complicated, grueling process. Being truly in shape is not a fantasy destination. Even becoming an elite athlete, if that&#x2019;s what you want to do, is surprisingly simple. All you need are a few minutes of strength training a day and a good understanding of the basics of nutrition. You find those minutes, and I&#x2019;ll show you what to do. You give me just a little more time, and I&#x2019;ll explain the nutrition basics that will simplify your eating choices for good.<br> &nbsp;<br> As much as I want you to look and feel good, this book is also ultimately about saving your life. It&#x2019;s a plain fact that unfit people are at far greater risk of suffering painful illnesses, immobility, and disease, from osteoporosis and arthritis to mortal threats like heart attack. Physical inactivity is the cause of one third of all deaths due to diabetes, colon cancer, and heart disease. We are all training for our lives. Whether you like it or not, life is the ultimate sport; you must approach it as an athlete would.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even if you haven&#x2019;t lifted anything but groceries in years, this book is the first to offer you total fitness independence. It will shatter old stereotypes and open your eyes to previously unimaginable possibilities of female athleticism. You will be training your body to do what it couldn&#x2019;t before. To use muscles it didn&#x2019;t before. To be fit and therefore look better than ever before.<br> &nbsp;<br> It sounds hokey, but I truly believe everyone possesses not only an inner beauty but an outer one as well. There are not ugly and pretty people. There are only fit people and unfit people. No one who is fit is not beautiful in her own way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether leading training sessions or missions, competing in Thai boxing competitions, or enjoying the few vacations I get, I&#x2019;ve been fortunate to travel a good part of this earth. From visiting my relatives in the Philippines and Germany&#x2014;where I lived until I was nine, without speaking a word of English&#x2014;to my military tours throughout the Middle East and Asia, I&#x2019;ve met people in just about every shape and form in which they exist. And never, not ever, have I found a kind of people that is not breathtakingly gorgeous. Of course, all the world&#x2019;s nationalities and ethnicities meet and mix in America, more than in any other country, and the results all are beautiful.<br> &nbsp;<br> What&#x2019;s not beautiful to me is the typical advertising of women. I see it in all the world&#x2019;s cities now: enormous billboards cast two stories high, parading some phony Western ideal of beauty&#x2014;tall, bone thin, and mainly white. And it&#x2019;s sad and a bit maddening to see so many millions of innately beautiful women walking the streets below, trying to emulate this ridiculous, marketing-driven ideal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most models have a body type possessed by a minority, mostly by very young and naturally thin women, and only for a genetically select few is it carried into their thirties, forties, fifties, sixties, and beyond without proper exercise and nutrition. From an early age, women are conditioned to value this standard, which is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve and maintain.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Governing Texas</h2><p><p><strong>The #1 package for thinking critically about the past, present, and future of Texas politics</strong></p> The most trusted source for comprehensive coverage.

Craig Barnes contends that the true calling of a pastor is to help others become fully alive in Christ, to be a "minor poet," or poet of the soul. As such, pastors are to read the major poets of Scripture and history in light of the dust and grit of daily parish life.<br><br><i>The Pastor as Minor Poet</i>&nbsp;eloquently calls pastors to search for a deeper understanding of what they see -- both in the text of Scripture and in the text of their parishioners' lives. A critical part of this poetic vision involves discerning key subtexts beneath these texts, which allows pastors to preach the heart of the Word and to understand the hearts of their people. Written with a seasoned pastor's depth of understanding and a poet's sensibility and sensitivity, this book will minister to and inspire pastors everywhere.</p><p><b>Walter Brueggemann</b><br> "Barnes knows all about being a pastor, how to use authority, how to lead, how to listen, and how to provoke.

Hinduism does not lend itself easily to a strictly chronological account. Many of its central texts cannot be reliably dated within a century; its central tenets arise at particular moments in Indian history and often differ according to gender or caste; and the differences between groups of Hindus far outnumber the commonalities. Yet the greatness of Hinduism lies precisely in many of these idiosyncratic qualities that continues to inspire debate today. This groundbreaking work elucidates the relationship between recorded history and imaginary worlds, the inner life and the social history of Hindus.</p><p><b>Wendy Doniger</b> holds doctorates in Sanskrit and Indian studies from Harvard and Oxford. She is the author of several translations of Sanskrit texts, including Penguin Classics editions of <i>Hindu Myths</i> and <i>The Rig Veda</i>, as well as many books about Hinduism. She is the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago.<p>PREFACE:<br> <b>THE MAN OR THE RABBIT<br> IN THE MOON<br></b><br> AN ALTERNATIVE HISTORY<br><br> The image of the man in the moon who is also a rabbit in the moon, or the duck who is also a rabbit, will serve as a metaphor for the double visions of the Hindus that this book will strive to present.<br><br> Since there are so many books about Hinduism, the author of yet another one has a duty to answer the potential reader&#x2019;s Passover question: Why shouldn&#x2019;t I pass over this book, or, Why is this book different from all other books? This book is not a brief survey (you noticed that already; I had intended it to be, but it got the bit between its teeth and ran away from me), nor, on the other hand, is it a reference book that covers all the facts and dates about Hinduism or a book about Hinduism as it is lived today. Several books of each of those sorts exist, some of them quite good, which you might read alongside this one.1&nbsp;<i>The Hindus: An Alternative History</i>&nbsp;differs from those books in several ways.<br><br> First, it highlights a narrative alternative to the one constituted by the most famous texts in Sanskrit (the literary language of ancient India) and represented in most surveys in English. It tells a story that incorporates the narratives of and about alternative people&#x2014;people who, from the standpoint of most high-caste Hindu males, are alternative in the sense of otherness, people of other religions, or cultures, or castes, or species (animals), or gender (women). Part of my agenda in writing an alternative history is to show how much the groups that conventional wisdom says were oppressed and silenced and played no part in the development of the tradition&#x2014;women, Pariahs (oppressed castes, sometimes called Untouchables)&#x2014;did actually contribute to Hinduism. My hope is not to reverse or misrepresent the hierarchies, which remain stubbornly hierarchical, or to deny that Sanskrit texts were almost always subject to a final filter in the hands of the male Brahmins (the highest of the four social classes, the class from which priests were drawn) who usually composed and preserved them. But I hope to bring in more actors, and more stories, upon the stage, to show the presence of brilliant and creative thinkers entirely off the track beaten by Brahmin Sanskritists and of diverse voices that slipped through the filter, and, indeed, to show that the filter itself was quite diverse, for there were many different sorts of Brahmins; some whispered into the ears of kings, but others were dirt poor and begged for their food every day.<br><br> Moreover, the privileged male who recorded the text always had access to oral texts as well as to the Sanskrit that was his professional language. Most people who knew Sanskrit must have been bilingual; the etymology of &#x201c;Sanskrit&#x201d; (&#x201c;perfected, artificial&#x201d;) is based upon an implicit comparison with &#x201c;Prakrit&#x201d; (&#x201c;primordial, natural&#x201d;), the language actually spoken. This gives me a double agenda: first to point out the places where the Sanskrit sources themselves include vernacular, female, and lower-class voices and then to include, wherever possible, non-Sanskrit sources. The (Sanskrit) medium is not always the message; a it&#x2019;s not all about Brahmins, Sanskrit, the&nbsp;<i>Gita</i>. I will concentrate on those moments within the tradition that resist forces that would standardize or establish a canon, moments that forged bridges between factions, the times of the &#x201c;mixing of classes&#x201d; (<i>varna-samkara</i>) that the Brahmins always tried&#x2014;inevitably in vain&#x2014;to prevent.<br><br> Second, in addition to focusing on a special group of actors, I have concentrated on a few important actions, several of which are also important to us today: nonviolence toward humans (particularly religious tolerance) and toward animals (particularly vegetarianism and objections to animal sacrifice) and the tensions between the householder life and renunciation, and between addiction and the control of sensuality. More specific images too (such as the transposition of heads onto bodies or the flooding of cities) thread their way through the entire historical fabric of the book. I have traced these themes through the chapters and across the centuries to provide some continuity in the midst of all the flux,2 even at the expense of what some might regard as more basic matters.<br><br> Third, this book attempts to set the narrative of religion within the narrative of history, as a linga (an emblem of the god Shiva, often representing his erect phallus) is set in a yoni (the symbol of Shiva&#x2019;s consort, or the female sexual organ), or any statue of a Hindu god in its base or plinth (<i>pitha</i>). I have organized the topics historically in order to show not only how each idea is a reaction to ideas that came before (as any good old-fashioned philological approach would do) but also, wherever possible, how those ideas were inspired or configured by the events of the times, how Hinduism, always context sensitive,3 responds to what is happening, at roughly the same moment, not only on the political and economic scene but within Buddhism or Islam in India or among people from other cultures entering India. For Hinduism, positioning kings as gods and gods as kings, seldom drew a sharp line between secular and religious power. In recent years a number of historians of religions, particularly of South Asian religions, have contextualized particular moments in the religious history of the subcontinent.4 This book attempts to extend that particularizing project to the whole sweep of Indian history, from the beginning (and I do mean the beginning, c. 50,000,000 BCE) to the present. This allows us to see how certain ongoing ideas evolve, which is harder to do with a focus on a particular event or text at a particular moment.<br><br> This will not serve as a conventional history (my training is as a philologist, not a historian) but as a book about the evolution of several important themes in the lives of Hindus caught up in the flow of historical change. It tells the story of the Hindus primarily through a string of narratives. The word for &#x201c;history&#x201d; in Sanskrit,&nbsp;<i>itihasa</i>, could be translated as &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what happened,&#x201d; giving the impression of an only slightly more modest equivalent of von Ranke&#x2019;s phrase for positivist history: &#x201c;<i>Wie es</i>&nbsp;[<i>eigentlich</i>]&nbsp;<i>gewesen ist</i>&#x201d; (&#x201c;The way it [really] happened&#x201d;). But the&nbsp;<i>iti</i>&nbsp;in the word is most often used as the Sanskrit equivalent of &#x201c;end quote,&#x201d; as in &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go [<i>iti</i>],&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<i>Itihasa</i>&nbsp;thus implies not so much what happened as what people&nbsp;<i>said</i>&nbsp;happened (&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he said happened&#x201d;)&#x2014;narratives, inevitably subjective narratives. And so this is a history not of what the British used to call maps and chaps (geography and biography) but of the stories in hi-story. It&#x2019;s a kind of narrative quilt made of scraps of religion sewn in next to scraps of social history, a quilt like those storytelling cloths that Indian narrators use as mnemonic devices to help them and the audience keep track of the plot. The narrator assembles the story from the quilt pieces much as the French rag-and-bones man, the&nbsp;<i>bricoleur</i>, makes new objects out of the broken-off pieces of old objects (bricolage).5<br><br> Like any work of scholarship, this book rests on the shoulders of many pygmies as well as giants. I have kept most of the scholarly controversies out of the text, after laying out the rules of the game in these first two chapters of methodological introduction and in the pre-Vedic period (chapters 2 through 4), which might stand as paradigms for what might have been done with all the other chapters, as well as a few other places where the arguments were so loony that I could not resist the temptation to satirize them. Many a &#x201c;fact&#x201d; turns out, on closer inspection, to be an argument. There is another story to be told here: how we know what we know, what we used to believe, why we believe what we believe now, what scholars brought up certain questions or gave us the information we now have, what scholars now challenge that information, and what political factors influenced them. Those arguments tell a story that is interesting in itself but to which I merely allude from time to time. I also write in the shadow of a broad scholarship of theories about religion and history, and I will keep that too out of the text. I have tried to avoid setting my opinions against those with whom I disagree or using them as fall guys, beginning an argument by citing the imagined opponent. I have, rather, simply presented each subject in what I believe to be the best scholarly construction, in order to concentrate on the arguments about it within the Hindu texts themselves.<br><br> Many crucial questions remain unanswered, and I hope that this book will inspire some readers to go back to the sources and decide for themselves whether or not they agree with me. The relevant materials can be found in the bibliography as well as in the notes for each chapter, which will also provide browsing material for those readers (I confess that I am one of them) who go straight to the back and look at the notes and bibliography first, reading the book like Hebrew, from right to left, to see where the author has been grazing, like dogs sniffing one another&#x2019;s backsides to see what they have eaten lately.b<br><br> SANSKRITIZATION, DESHIFICATION, AND VERNACULARIZATION<br><br> Sanskrit texts from the earliest period assimilated folk texts that were largely oral and composed in languages other than Sanskrit, vernacular languages. But even in the Vedic age, Sanskrit was not what has been called a kitchen language, c not the language in which you said, &#x201c;Pass the butter.&#x201d;6 (Actually, Brahminsprobably did say, &#x201c;Pass the butter,&#x201d; in Sanskrit when they put butter as an oblation into the fire in the course of the sacrifice, but those same Brahmins would have to have known how to say it in another language as well, in the kitchen.) At the very least, those male Sanskritists had to be bilingual in order to talk to their wives and servants and children.d It was through those interactions that oral traditions got their foot in the Sanskrit door. Henry Higgins, in George Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Pygmalion</i>, is said to be the author of&nbsp;<i>Spoken Sanskrit</i>, and many priests and scholars can speak Sanskrit, but no one ever spoke&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;pure Sanskrit. Sanskrit and oral traditions flow back and forth, producing a constant infusion of lower-class words and ideas into the Brahmin world, and vice versa.<br><br> It must have been the case that the natural language, Prakrit, and the vernaculars came first, while Sanskrit, the refined, secondary revision, the artificial language, came later. But South Asianists often seem to assume that it is the other way around, that the dialects are &#x201c;derived from Sanskrit,&#x201d; because Sanskrit won the race to the archives and was the first to be written down and preserved, and we only encounter vernaculars much later. So we say that Sanskrit is older, and the vernaculars younger. But Sanskrit, the language of power, emerged in India from a minority, and at first its power came precisely from its nonintelligibility and unavailability, which made it the power of an elite group.7 Walt Kelly&#x2019;s Pogo used to use the word &#x201c;Sam-skrimps&#x201d; to describe highfalutin double-talk or manipulative twaddle. Many Euro-Americans mispronounce it &#x201c;Sanscript,&#x201d; implying that it is a language without (<i>sans</i>) an (intelligible) script, or &#x201c;Sand-script,&#x201d; with overtones of ruined cities in the desert or a lost language written in sand.<br><br> The sociologist M. N. Srinivas, in 1952, coined the useful term &#x201c;Sanskritization&#x201d; to describe the way that Vedic social values, Vedic ritual forms, and Sanskrit learning seep into local popular traditions of ritual and ideology (in part through people who hope to be upwardly mobile, to rise by imitating the manners and habits, particularly food taboos, of Brahmins, and in particular avoiding violence to animals).8 Indian society, in this view, is a permanent floating game of snakes and ladders (or, perhaps, snakes and ropes, recalling that Vedantic philosophers mistake snakes for ropes and that you can climb up on ropes in the Indian rope trick), which you enter in a state of impurity, gradually advancing over the generations toward the goal of Brahminical purity, trying to avoid the many pitfalls along the way.9 Tribal groups (Bhils, Gonds, etc.) might undergo Sanskritization in order to claim to be a caste, and therefore, Hindu.10<br><br> But the opposite of Sanskritization, the process by which the Sanskritic tradition simultaneously absorbs and transforms those same popular traditions, is equally important, and that process might be called oralization, or popularization, or even, perhaps, Deshification (from the &#x201c;local&#x201d; or&nbsp;<i>deshi</i>&nbsp;traditions) or Laukification, from what Sanskrit calls&nbsp;<i>laukika</i>&nbsp;(&#x201c;of the people&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>[loka]</i>). Let&#x2019;s settle on Deshification. The two processes of Sanskritization and Deshification beget each other. Similarly, through a kind of&nbsp;<i>identificatio brahmanica</i>,11 local gods take on the names of gods in Sanskrit texts: Murukan becomes Skanda, a kind of Sanskritization, while at the same time there is an&nbsp;<i>identificatio deshika</i>, by which Sanskrit gods take on the characteristics of local gods, and to the people who worship Murukan, it is Murukan who is absorbing Skanda, not the reverse. &#x201c;Cross-fertilization&#x201d; might be a good, equalizing term for the combination of the two processes.<br><br> &#x201c;Written&#x201d; does not necessarily mean &#x201c;written in Sanskrit,&#x201d; nor are oral texts always in the vernacular (the&nbsp;<i>Rig Veda,</i>&nbsp;after all, was preserved orally in Sanskrit for many centuries before it was consigned to writing). We cannot equate vernacular with oral, for people both write and speak both Sanskrit and the vernacular languages of India, though Sanskrit is written more often than spoken. The distinction between Sanskrit and the vernacular literatures is basically geographical: Though there are regional Sanskrits, the vernaculars, unlike Sanskrit, are defined and named by their place of origin (Bangla from Bengal, Oriya from Orissa, and so forth), while the script in which Sanskrit is most often written allegedly has no particular earthly place of origin (it is called &#x201c;the [script of the] city of the gods [<i>deva-nagari</i>]&#x201d;). Once people departed from the royal road of Sanskrit literary texts, there were thousands of vernacular paths that they could take, often still keeping one foot on the high road of Sanskrit.<br><br> The constant, gradual, unofficial mutual exchange between Sanskrit and the vernacular languages, the cross-fertilization, underwent a dramatic transformation toward the middle of the second millennium: Local languages were now promoted officially, politically, and artistically,12 replacing the previously fashionable cosmopolitan and translocal language, Sanskrit. Instead of nourishing and supplementing Sanskrit, the vernacular languages as literary languages began to compete with Sanskrit as the language of literary production. This process has been called, in imitation of Srinivas&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sanskritization&#x201d; (and in contrast with both Deshification and the more mutually nourishing, two-way proc...</p></p><h2>The Girl Before: A Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � In the tradition of <i>The Girl on the Train, The Woman in Cabin 10, </i>and<i> Gone Girl </i>comes an enthralling psychological thriller that spins one woman&#x2019;s seemingly good fortune, and another woman&#x2019;s mysterious fate, through a kaleidoscope of duplicity, death, and deception.</b><br><br><b>SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE DIRECTED BY RON HOWARD</b><br><br><i>Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.</i><br><br>The request seems odd, even intrusive&#x2014;and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating.<br><br> <b>EMMA</b><br> Reeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live.

Close to the amenities. And there&#x2019;s that private bit of roof. That could become a sun terrace, subject of course to the landlord&#x2019;s consent.<br><br>Nice, Simon agrees, trying not to catch my eye. I&#x2019;d known the flat was no good as soon as I walked in and saw that six-�foot stretch of roof below one of the windows. Si knows it too but he doesn&#x2019;t want to tell the agent, or at least not so soon it&#x2019;ll seem rude. He might even hope that if I listen to the man&#x2019;s stupid patter long enough I&#x2019;ll waver. The agent&#x2019;s Simon&#x2019;s kind of guy: sharp, brash, eager. He probably reads the magazine Simon works for. They were exchanging sports chat before we even got up the stairs.<br><br>And here you have a decent-�sized bedroom, the agent&#x2019;s saying. With ample&#x2014;�<br><br>It&#x2019;s no good, I interrupt, cutting short the charade. It&#x2019;s not right for us.<br><br>The agent raises his eyebrows. You can&#x2019;t be too choosy in this market, he says. This&#x2019;ll be gone by tonight. Five viewings today, and it&#x2019;s not even on our website yet.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not secure enough, I say flatly. Shall we go?<br><br>There are locks on all the windows, he points out, plus a Chubb on the door. Of course, you could install a burglar alarm, if security&#x2019;s a particular concern. I don&#x2019;t think the landlord would have any objection.<br><br>He&#x2019;s talking across me now, to Simon. Particular concern. He might as well have said, Oh, is the girlfriend a bit of a drama queen?<br><br>I&#x2019;ll wait outside, I say, turning to leave.<br><br>Realizing he&#x2019;s blundered, the agent adds, If it&#x2019;s the area that&#x2019;s the problem, perhaps you should have a look farther west.<br><br>We already have, Simon says. It&#x2019;s all out of our budget. Apart from the ones the size of a tea bag.<br><br>He&#x2019;s trying to keep the frustration out of his voice, but the fact that he needs to riles me even more.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a one-�bedroom in Queen&#x2019;s Park, the agent says. A bit grotty, but . . .<br><br>We looked at it, Simon says. In the end we felt it was just a bit too close to that estate. His tone makes it clear that we means &#x201c;she.&#x201d;<br><br>Or there&#x2019;s a third-�floor just come on in Kilburn&#x2014;�<br><br>That too. There was a drainpipe next to one of the windows.<br><br>The agent looks puzzled.<br><br>Someone could have climbed it, Simon explains.<br><br>Right. Well, the rental season&#x2019;s only just started. Perhaps if you wait a bit.<br><br>The agent has clearly decided we&#x2019;re time-�wasters: He too is sidling toward the door. I go and stand outside, on the landing, so he won&#x2019;t come near me.<br><br>We&#x2019;ve already given notice on our old place, I hear Simon say. We&#x2019;re running out of options. He lowers his voice. Look, mate, we were burgled. Five weeks ago. Two men broke in and threatened Emma with a knife. You can see why she&#x2019;d be a bit jumpy.<br><br>Oh, the agent says. Shit. If someone did that to my girlfriend I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;d do. Look, this might be a long shot, but . . . His voice trails off.<br><br>Yes? Simon says.<br><br>Has anyone at the office mentioned One Folgate Street to you?<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think so. Has it just come on?<br><br>Not exactly, no.<br><br>The agent seems unsure whether to pursue this or not.<br><br>But it&#x2019;s available? Simon persists.<br><br>Technically, yes, the agent says. And it&#x2019;s a fantastic property. Absolutely fantastic. In a different league from this. But the landlord&#x2019;s . . . to say he&#x2019;s particular would be putting it mildly.<br><br>What area? Simon asks.<br><br>Hampstead, the agent says. Well, more like Hendon. But it&#x2019;s really quiet.<br><br>Em? Simon calls.<br><br>I go back inside. We might as well take a look, I say. We&#x2019;re halfway there now.<br><br>The agent nods. I&#x2019;ll stop by the office, he says, see if I can locate the details. It&#x2019;s been a while since I showed anyone around, actually. It&#x2019;s not a place that would suit just anyone. But I think it might be right up your street. Sorry, no pun intended.<br><br>Now: Jane<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last one.&#x201d; The agent, whose name is Camilla, drums her fingers on the steering wheel of her Smart car. &#x201c;So really, it&#x2019;s time to make up our minds.&#x201d;<br><br>I sigh. The flat we&#x2019;ve just viewed, in a run-�down mansion block off West End Lane, is the only one in my price range. And I&#x2019;d just about persuaded myself it was all right&#x2014;�ignoring the peeling wallpaper, the faint smell of someone else&#x2019;s cooking seeping up from the flat below, the poky bedroom and the mold spattered across the unventilated bathroom&#x2014;�until I&#x2019;d heard a bell being rung nearby, an old-�fashioned hand bell, and the place was suddenly filled with the noise of children. Going to the window, I found myself looking down at a school. I could see into a room being used by a toddler group, the windows hung with cutouts of paper bunnies and geese. Pain tugged at my insides.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll pass on this one,&#x201d; I managed to say.<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Camilla seemed surprised. &#x201c;Is it the school? The previous tenants said they rather liked the sound of children playing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Though not so much they decided to stay.&#x201d; I turned away. &#x201c;Shall we go?&#x201d;<br><br>Now Camilla leaves a long, tactical silence as she drives us back to her office. Eventually she says, &#x201c;If nothing we saw today took your fancy, we might have to think about upping your budget.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, my budget can&#x2019;t budge,&#x201d; I say drily, looking out the window.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you might have to be a bit less picky,&#x201d; she says tartly.<br><br>&#x201c;About that last one. There are . . . personal reasons why I can&#x2019;t live next to a school. Not right now.&#x201d;<br><br>I see her eyes going to my stomach, still a little flabby from my pregnancy, and her eyes widen as she makes the connection. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; she says. Camilla isn&#x2019;t quite as dim as she looks, for which I&#x2019;m grateful. She doesn&#x2019;t need me to spell it out.<br><br>Instead, she seems to come to a decision.<br><br>&#x201c;Look, there is one other place. We&#x2019;re not really meant to show it without the owner&#x2019;s express permission, but occasionally we do anyway. It freaks some people out, but personally I think it&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An amazing property on my budget? We&#x2019;re not talking about a houseboat, are we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;God, no. Almost the opposite. A modern building in Hendon. A whole house&#x2014;�only one bedroom, but loads of space. The owner is the architect. He&#x2019;s actually really famous. Do you ever buy clothes at Wanderer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wanderer . . .&#x201d; In my previous life, when I had money and a proper, well-�paid job, I did sometimes go into the Wanderer shop on Bond Street, a terrifyingly minimalist space where a handful of eye-�wateringly expensive dresses were laid out on thick stone slabs like sacrificial virgins, and the sales assistants all dressed in black kimonos. &#x201c;Occasionally. Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Monkford Partnership designs all their stores. He&#x2019;s what they call a techno-�minimalist or something. Lots of hidden gadgetry, but otherwise everything&#x2019;s completely bare.&#x201d; She shoots me a look. &#x201c;I should warn you, some people find his style a bit . . . austere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can cope with that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; I prompt, when she doesn&#x2019;t go on.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a straightforward landlord&#x2013;�tenant agreement,&#x201d; she says hesitantly.<br><br>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; she says, flicking down her indicator and moving into the left-�hand lane, &#x201c;we should take a look at the property first, see if you fall in love with it. Then I&#x2019;ll explain the drawbacks.&#x201d;</p><h2>Echoes of Honor (Honor Harrington Series, Book 8)</h2><p>Her enemies think she has been executed, but Commodore Honor Harrington is actually interned on the prison planet Hell, from which she is determined to escape. Reissue.</p><p>David Weber provides intergalactic thrills and political intrigue in this far-flung military space adventure, continuing where <i>In Enemy Hands</i> left off. The People's Republic has publicly executed Honor Harrington--or have they? While the Star Kingdom swears revenge, Honor (alive and kicking) plans escape from the prison planet of Hell. Weber's extensive knowledge of military protocol combined with deep technical exploration make for a highly detailed book, yet he avoids bogging down in it. His great storytelling skills keep this book racing along like an action-adventure movie. Fans of <i>Star Wars</i> and old-fashioned seafaring tales will find lots to their liking here, as will those looking for a future setting in which women play an equal role. If you're new to the Honor series, start with <i>On Basilisk Station</i>, the first of Commander Honor Harrington's adventures.BACK FROM HELL<p>For eight bloody years, the Star Kingdom of Manticore and its allies have taken the war to the vastly more powerful People's Republic of Haven, and Commodore Honor Harrington has been in the forefront of that war. But now Honor has fallen, captured by the Peep Navy, turned over to the forces of State Security . . . and executed on the interstellar network's nightly news.</p><p>The Manticoran Alliance is stunned and infuriated by Honor's death and grimly resolved to avenge it. Yet their military is over-extended and the People's Republic is poised to take the offensive with unprecedented ferocity.</p><p>But even as powerful Peep fleets hurtle towards their objectives, neither they nor the Alliance are aware of events occurring on a distant, isolated, inescapable prison planet called Hell. For what no one knows, not even State Security, is that Honor Harrington is not dead. She and a handful of her people are trapped on Hell, and determined to disprove the Peep boast that no one can ever escape it.</p><p>Honor Harrington is going home, and taking her people with her . . . even if she has to conquer Hell to do it.</p></p><h2>The Sagebrush State, 5th Edition: Nevada&#39;s History, Government, and Politics (Volume 5) (Shepperson Series in Nevada History)</h2><p>Nevada&#x2019;s politics are in large measure the result of its turbulent history and harsh environment.

And nowhere does this terror translate to blind acceptance of authority more than in the slippery world of averages, correlations, graphs, and trends. Huff sought to break through "the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind" with this slim volume, first published in 1954. The book remains relevant as a wake-up call for people unaccustomed to examining the endless flow of numbers pouring from Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and everywhere else someone has an axe to grind, a point to prove, or a product to sell. "The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify," warns Huff.<p> Although many of the examples used in the book are charmingly dated, the cautions are timeless. Statistics are rife with opportunities for misuse, from "gee-whiz graphs" that add nonexistent drama to trends, to "results" detached from their method and meaning, to statistics' ultimate bugaboo--faulty cause-and-effect reasoning. Huff's tone is tolerant and amused, but no-nonsense. Like a lecturing father, he expects you to learn something useful from the book, and start applying it every day. Never be a sucker again, he cries!</p><p> </p><blockquote>Even if you can't find a source of demonstrable bias, allow yourself some degree of skepticism about the results as long as there is a possibility of bias somewhere. There always is.</blockquote><p> Read <i>How to Lie with Statistics</i>. Whether you encounter statistics at work, at school, or in advertising, you'll remember its simple lessons. Don't be terrorized by numbers, Huff implores.

She'd tried her usual smile, had figured outsomething was different when Milo didn't stoop to pet her.<br><br>&nbsp;I rubbed her knobby head. She looked up at me, returnedher attention to the monitor.<br><br>&nbsp;The woman's lips moved.<br><br>Milo said, "Here we go."<br><br>&nbsp;More silence on the screen.<br><br>"So I lied."<br><br>The woman said, "My name is Elise Freeman. I'm ateacher and tutor at Windsor Preparatory Academy in Brentwood." Her voicewas throaty. She knotted her fingers, flopped them onto her lap. "I'mmaking this recording to document sustained abuse I have received at the handsof faculty members at Windsor Preparatory Academy in Brentwood. Which I willhereon refer to as Prep."<br><br>Deep breath. "For the past two years at Prep, I havebeen subjected to repeated, unwarranted, aggressive, and distressing sexualharassment from three individuals. Their names are." Her right hand rose.A finger pointed upward. "Enrico Hauer. H-A-U-E-R." Two fingers:"James Winterthorn." More slow, enunciated spelling, then a trio ofdigits. "Pat Skaggs."<br><br>&nbsp;The hand dropped. "For the past two years EnricoHauer, James Winterthorn, and Pat Skaggs have made my life a living hell byengaging in brutal, unsolicited, and threatening sexual behavior. I am makingthis recording so that in the event something violent happens to me, theauthorities will know where to look. I do not know what else to do as I feeltrapped and frightened and have nowhere to turn. I hope this recording neverneeds to come to light but if it does, I am glad that I made it."<br><br>Her eyes clenched shut. Her lips moved soundlessly andshe slumped. Suddenly her jaw jutted and she was sitting up straight. Moredefiance than defeat.<br><br>Staring hard at the camera. "Thanks forlistening."<br><br>&nbsp;The screen went blue. Milo said, "Talk about a D-movieplot device."<br><br>&nbsp;I said, "But you're here. She was murdered?"<br><br>"Maybe. She's on ice."<br><br>"Backlog at the coroner?"<br><br>&nbsp;His laughter was harsh. "Nope, this morning I'm Mr.Literal. Ice of the dry sort. Frozen CO2. She was found in her home, lying in abathtub full of the stuff."<br><br>I tried to picture the blond woman as a frozen corpse, didn'tlike the image that flashed in my head, and reverted to Doctor Helpful."Someone trying to mess up the time-of-death estimate? Or maybe apsychopath coming up with a new way to showcase his handiwork."<br><br>&nbsp;He winced, as if all contingencies were painful. Removingthe disc, he slipped it back into a clear plastic jewel box. Not bothering toglove up; the DVD had already been printed, matched only to Elise Freeman.<br><br>&nbsp;I said, "Where are you going with this?"<br><br>He rotated his neck. "Got coffee? Maybe sometoast?"<br><br><i>Chapter Two</i>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;We left myhouse with black coffee in travel-cups and six slices of lavishly butteredsesame-rye.<br><br>&nbsp;When Milo wants to think, phone, text, or sleep hesometimes asks me to do the driving. It's against LAPD regs but so are lots ofthings. He makes up for my mileage cost with bar tabs and such.<br><br>&nbsp;The toast was occupying his attention so I offered totake my Seville. He shook his head, scattering crumbs, continued to his latestunmarked, a bronze Chevy Malibu with a phlegmy ignition. Heading north onBeverly Glen, he steered with one hand, stuffed rye bread into his mouth withthe other.<br><br>The police radio was switched off. The burrito rested inthe backseat and filled the car with eau de frijole.<br><br>&nbsp;He said, "In answer to your question, toomessy."<br><br>"That was low on my list of questions. Where are wegoing?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Where she died, Studio City."<br><br>"Not a West L.A. case but you're on it."<br><br>&nbsp;"Not an official homicide but I'm on it."<br><br>The difference between an experienced psychologist and anovice is knowing when not to speak.<br><br>I sat back and drank coffee.<br><br>&nbsp;Milo said, "Maybe there'll be a microwave and I canheat up the burrito."<br><br>&nbsp;Elise Freeman had resided in a green-sided, tar-roofedbungalow on a spidery, tree-shaded lane east of Laurel Canyon and north ofVentura Boulevard. Close enough to the thoroughfare to hear Valley traffic, butmature vegetation and larger houses blocked any urban visuals.<br><br>&nbsp;The little green box sat at the terminus of a long dirtdriveway split by a strip of concrete. A gray sedan was parked near the frontdoor. Full-sized car but not big enough to hide the bungalow's blemishes as wedrew close: worn and ragged siding eroded to raw wood in patches, curlingshingles, a noticeable listing to the right due to a sinking foundation.<br><br>No crime scene tape that I could see, no uniforms onwatch.<br><br>&nbsp;I said, "When was she found?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Last night by her boyfriend. He says he talked toher on the phone three days ago but after that, she stopped returning hiscalls. A forty-eight-hour time frame fits the coroner's TOD guesstimate.Probably at the tail end-early morning. Apparently, dry ice doesn't melt, itsublimates-goes straight into the atmosphere-so there's no water residue forestimating degradation. In an ice chest, the rate of sublimation is five to tenpounds every twenty-four hours, but it's faster under normal roomtemperature."<br><br>&nbsp;"Any empty ice bags left behind?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Nope. Exactly."<br><br>&nbsp;Someone had cleaned up.<br><br>&nbsp;"The scene's still intact?"<br><br>He scowled. "I never got a chance to see the scenebecause my involvement began at five thirty a.m. today when Deputy ChiefWeinberg woke me from a rare good dream. The DVD, the key to the house, and what'spassing for a file were messengered to my house ten minutes later."<br><br>"High intrigue and an egregious break inprocedure," I said. "Sounds like orders from on high."<br><br>&nbsp;He continued slowly up the drive, checking out thesurroundings. Layers of greenery to the left, a two-story Colonial mansion tothe right. The big house was wood-sided like the bungalow, but what I could seeof it was painted white and adorned with black shutters. It sat on a generouslot partitioned from Freeman's skimpy ribbon of real estate by a ten-footstucco fence topped with used brick. Bougainvillea topped areas of brick,amping up the privacy quotient on both sides.<br><br>&nbsp;The smaller structure might've begun life as anoutbuilding of the manse, back when multi-acre estates spread across Valleyhillsides. A guesthouse, servant's quarters, maybe tack storage for one of thecowboy actors wanting proximity to the Burbank film-lots that passed for WildWest badlands.<br><br>Milo rolled to a stop inches from the Crown Vic. No oneat the wheel, but a man in a cream-colored suit emerged from behind thebungalow.<br><br>&nbsp;A hair over Milo's six three, he was broad, black,bespectacled. The suit was double-breasted and tailored to nearly conceal a gunbulge.<br><br>&nbsp;He gave a cursory nod. "Milo."<br><br>&nbsp;"Stan."<br><br>&nbsp;"And this is..."<br><br>"Dr. Delaware."<br><br>&nbsp;"Your psychologist."<br><br>&nbsp;"That makes it sound like I'm in therapy,Stan."<br><br>&nbsp;"Therapy's in fashion now, Milo. The departmentlooks kindly on self-awareness and insight."<br><br>&nbsp;"Must have missed that memo."<br><br>&nbsp;A big hand extended. "Stanley Creighton,Doctor."<br><br>&nbsp;We shook.<br><br>Milo said, "What brings you down from Olympus,Stan?"<br><br>"More like Bunker Hill," said Creighton."I'm here to keep an eye out."<br><br>"New clause in the captain's job description?"<br><br>&nbsp;Creighton said, "One does what one is told." Heturned to me. "Speaking of which, Doctor, I appreciate what you do but youshouldn't be here."<br><br>&nbsp;"He's cleared for takeoff, Stan."<br><br>&nbsp;Creighton frowned. Cool morning but the back of his neckwas moist ebony. "I must've missed that memo."<br><br>&nbsp;"Probably buried under a pile of wisdom from HisMunificence."<br><br>Creighton flashed beautiful teeth. "Why don't youcall him that to his face? Doctor, you really need to absent yourself."<br><br>&nbsp;"Stan, he really doesn't."<br><br>&nbsp;Creighton's smile degraded to something cold andmenacing. "You're telling me you got papal dispensation for his presenceat this specific crime scene?"<br><br>"Why would I improvise about that, Stan?"<br><br>"Why indeed," said Creighton. "Except forthe fact that rationality doesn't always figure into human behavior. Which iswhy my wife, who has an M.D., still smokes a pack and a half a day."<br><br>"Feel free to call the Vatican to verify,Stan."<br><br>Creighton studied me. "Can I assume that LieutenantSturgis has informed you of the need for exceptional discretion here,Doctor?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Absolutely."<br><br>"Exceptional," he repeated.<br><br>&nbsp;"I love exceptions," I said.<br><br>&nbsp;"Why's that, Doctor?"<br><br>&nbsp;"They're a lot more interesting than rules."<br><br>Creighton tried to smile again. The result fit him likepanty hose on a mastiff. "I respect what you do, Doctor. My wife's aneurologist, works with psychologists all the time. But now I'm wondering ifLieutenant Sturgis relies on you so not because of your professional skills,maybe it's more of a personality thing." Expanding his chest. "As inwiseass loves company."<br><br>Before I could answer he wheeled on Milo. "How muchtime are you going to need here?"<br><br>"Hard to say."<br><br>&nbsp;"I'm after a little more precision."<br><br>&nbsp;"C'mon, Stan-"<br><br>"You've already seen the crime scene pix, the body'slong gone, the prints and fluid swabs are at the lab, and your vic's computerwas lifted, so what do you expect to accomplish?"<br><br>No mention of the DVD.<br><br>Milo said, "Hell, Stan, why even bother to work whenwe can go on detective.com?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Yuk yuk yuk, ka-ching, rim shot," saidCreighton. "Bottom line: There's nothing this place can tell you. Unlessyou're one of those paranormals, think you can feel vibrations."<br><br>"You were in my place you wouldn't do a walk-through?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Sure, cover your ass. But walk quickly. I've beenhere since six a.m., which is an hour after Weinberg woke me up and gave me myorders. Morning's aren't my fun time. This particular morning, my knee's beinga nasty bitch. So what I'm gonna do right now is go for a nice, loose walk andwhen I get back, I strongly prefer to see you the hell out of here so I can getthe hell out of here and do the job they officially pay me for."<br><br>&nbsp;Favoring me with a contemptuous glance. "Be careful,Doctor."<br><br>We watched him stride off, limping slightly.<br><br>I said, "Who'd he play for?"<br><br>"U. Nevada, didn't make the big-time."<br><br>&nbsp;"What do they officially pay him for?"<br><br>&nbsp;"He used to work Sex Crimes. Now he pushes paper andattends meetings."<br><br>"And occasionally plays watchman."<br><br>"Funny 'bout that."<br><br>&nbsp;We continued toward the green house.<br>&nbsp;I said, "If it's all so hush-hush how'd you get thechief to approve me?" <br><br>"I'll answer that once you're approved."<br><br>The bungalow's front porch creaked under our weight. Ahummingbird feeder dangling from the overhang was empty and dry. Milo pulledout a tagged key and unlocked the door and we stepped into a small, dim livingroom. Blank space atop a TV table.<br><br>&nbsp;I said, "Her video gear's at the lab?"<br><br>Nod.<br><br>&nbsp;"Where was the DVD found?"<br><br>"Stuck in the middle of a stack of her favoritemovies. Or so the file claims."<br><br>"Creighton didn't mention it."<br><br>"Like I said, it got messengered."<br><br>"By who?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Guy in a suit."<br><br>"And a badge?"<br><br>&nbsp;"That, too."<br><br>&nbsp;"A note in the envelope said it was found in a stackof the victim's DVDs."<br><br>&nbsp;"But not cataloged as evidence."<br><br>"Funny 'bout that."<br><br>"Who took the initial call?"<br><br>"Two North Hollywood D's who have absolutely nothingto say to me."<br><br>"Are you planning to tell me what got the gearsgrinding?"<br><br>&nbsp;"It wasn't her," he said. "They couldn'tcare less about her. That's the point, Alex."<br><br>&nbsp;I said, "The suspects are the point. Where they'reemployed."<br><br>"You never heard that from me."<br><br>&nbsp;"A school has that much clout?"<br><br>&nbsp;"It does when the right people's kids are enrolled.You ever have patients from Windsor Prep?"<br><br>"A few."<br><br>&nbsp;"Any pattern you'd care to share?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Affluent, attractive kids. For the most part,bright, but under lots of pressure academically, athletically, and socially. Inother words, no different from any other prep school."<br><br>"This case makes it real different."<br><br>"Because of one student in particular."<br><br>&nbsp;Silence.<br><br>"College applications go in soon," I said."Here's a wild guess: The chief has a kid aiming for the Ivy League."<br><br>&nbsp;He shoved a coarse shock of hair off his brow. Fuzzylight advertised every pock and knot on his face. "I never heard that fromyou."<br><br>"Son or daughter?"<br><br>"Son," he said. "Only child. Another Einstein,according to his mommy, the Virgin Mary."<br><br>"Talk about a mixed metaphor."<br><br>&nbsp;"What the hell, they were both nice Jewishboys."<br><br>"Graduating senior?"<br><br>"Graduating with honors and aiming for Yale."<br><br>I said, "It's the toughest year ever, huge upsurgeof applications, lots of honor students are going to be disappointed. A coupleof patients I saw as little kids have come back for moral support and they saythe most trivial factor can nudge the scales. A big-time scandal would energizethe Rejection Gods."<br><br>He bowed. "O Great Swami of the East, your wisdomhas pierced the miasma." He began circling the room. "Ol' Stanley waswrong. Why I rely upon you has nothing to do with personality."<br><br>&nbsp;Creighton might've been off about that but to my eye hewas right about the house yielding nothing of value.<br><br>&nbsp;The miserly space had already taken on an abandoned feel.The front room, carelessly and cheaply furnished, sported ...</p><h2>Native Plants, Native Healing: Traditional Muskagee Way</h2><p>Traditional Muskogee Way.

Here, she deepened her studies of mysticism and ancient wisdom through meditation, yogic philosophy and spiritual psychology. <p>In the late 1980s after many years of an amazing inner journey, practicing meditation and self-inquiry, Leslie experienced a complete dissolution of her old identity and a profound spiritual transformation and awakening.

Some were memories of his own journey of ascendance in the company of <i>his </i>father, Auitchitcuk, of the tests that had earned him the right to wear his baldric, to carry a weapon in city, to choose and confirm his name.<br><br><i>Two hundred years, and the forest is still the same--only I am the father now, not the son....</i><br><br>Chewbacca also vividly remembered the foolish expedition he and Salporin had made to the Shadow Forest in advance of their coming-of-age. Unarmed but for a single <i>ryyyk</i> blade Salporin had pilfered from his eldest brother, Chewbacca and his friend had left the nursery ring and descended into realms forbidden to the children they still were.<br><br>They had thought to prepare themselves for the unknown, but managed only to scare themselves with it. Their courage had faded with the failing light, and by the time they reached Shadow Forest, all it took was a skittish trap-spinner to send them fleeing back to the safety of the familiar.<br><br><i>And what we thought we saw filled our nightmares until our tests of ascension finally came Poor Salporin! I only had to wait six days.</i><br><br>If Attitchitcuk knew--then or later--what they had done, he had never let on.<br><br>Chewbacca looked at his son appraisingly. He doubted that there were any secret journeys concealed behind those nervous eyes. Years ago, a very young Lumpawarrump had gone alone into the forest near Rwookrrorro in search of <i>wasaka</i> berries and gotten himself lost--a misadventure that had grown much in the retelling, until it became a family fable populated by every monster of the dark depths of both jungle and imagination. But the scare had been real even if the danger had not, and since then his son had been content to stay close to the nursery ring and the home tree.<br><br>And Mallatobuck and Attitchitcuk had been content to allow it, to let him be different. Neither, it seemed, had pushed him to take part in the toughening--the unstructured rough-and-tumble play of the nursery ring, where young Wookiees learned their fearlessly headlong fighting style. When Chewbacca had greeted his son with a fierce growling rush, Lumpawarrump had turned from it, yielding as though he were already wounded.<br><br>It had been a difficult moment for everyone. But in the aftermath, Chewbacca realized that he was seeing part of the price his son had paid for his absence.<br><br>In honoring a life debt to Han Solo, Chewbacca had left his son to be raised by mother and grandfather. He could not fault their love or their care, but something had been missing--something to spark the <i>rrakktor, </i>the defiant fire, the eager strength that was a Wookiee's heart. Lumpawarrump did not even have a friend like Salporin to test himself against in daily clinches and slap-fights.<br><br>The calendar said that it was time. Lumpawarrump had sprung up to adult height. But he had only begun to fill out that tall frame, and it was clear that he did not yet feel the power of his size. It was also not difficult to see that Lumpawarrump was in awe of his famous father, and paralyzingly anxious for his approval. Beyond that, Chewbacca was still trying to take his measure.<br><br>His son had talent in his hands. Though he had dragged out the task through nine days, Lumpawarrump had done a skillful job constructing his bowcaster--its weaknesses were the kind that only experience would teach him to correct. And he had shown a steady hand in downing a <i>kroyies</i> with it, the first of the hunting tests.<br><br>But the second test, trapping and killing a big-eyed scuttle grazer on level three, had taken even longer and not gone as well. And the test waiting ahead, inside the Well of the Dead, promised to ask more of Lumpy than he was ready to face.<br><br>[Explain to me what we see,] he said to his son.<br><br>[It is a wound in the forest, where something fell from the sky long ago. It is the bottom of the great pit of Anarrad, which we see from the high lookouts of Rwookrrorro--]<br><br>[Why did Kashyyyk not heal the wound?]<br><br>[I do not know, Father.]<br><br>[Because she needed a home for the katam. The light falls to the depths and calls forth the young vitality of the <i>wroshyr</i>. The green leaves shelter the daubirds and sustain the sprites and mallakins. The daubirds invite the netcasters, and the mallakins call the grove harriers. And the katarn, the old prince of the forest, comes to the kast.]<br><br>[If Kashyyyk has given the katarn this place, why must we hunt them?]<br><br>[It is our pact with them, from long ago.]<br><br>[I do not understand.]<br><br>[Once they hunted us, and the richness of the high forest was theirs for a thousand generations. But their hunting did not destroy us. Nothing of this world is to be squandered, my son. The katarn gave the Wookiee its strength and courage, and allowed the Wookiee to find the <i>rrakktorr. </i>Now we hunt them to repay the gift.

In this illuminating essay, John Higgs takes us on a whirlwind tour to prove that far from being the mere New Age counterculture figure that many assume him to be, Blake is now more relevant than ever.</p><p></p><h2>The Writer&#39;s Notebook: Craft Essays from Tin House</h2><p><p><strong>The Writer's Notebook offers aspiring authors the most enlightening and engaging seminars and essays from some of Tin House's favorite writers.

We have a consumption crisis. And this book, which takes aim at cherished assumptions regarding energy, offers refreshingly straight talk about what&#x2019;s wrong with the way we think and talk about the problem. Though we generally believe we can solve environmental problems with more energy&#x2014;more solar cells, wind turbines, and biofuels&#x2014;alternative technologies come with their own side effects and limitations. How, for instance, do solar cells cause harm? Why can&#x2019;t engineers solve wind power&#x2019;s biggest obstacle? Why won&#x2019;t contraception solve the problem of overpopulation lying at the heart of our concerns about energy, and what will? <br>This practical, environmentally informed, and lucid book persuasively argues for a change of perspective. If consumption is the problem, as Ozzie Zehner suggests, then we need to shift our focus from suspect alternative energies to improving social and political fundamentals: walkable communities, improved consumption, enlightened governance, and, most notably, women&#x2019;s rights. The dozens of first steps he offers are surprisingly straightforward. For instance, he introduces a simple sticker that promises a greater impact than all of the nation&#x2019;s solar cells. He uncovers why carbon taxes won&#x2019;t solve our energy challenges (and presents two taxes that could). Finally, he explores how future environmentalists will focus on similarly fresh alternatives that are affordable, clean, and can actually improve our well-being. <br>Watch a book trailer.</p><p>Green Illusions is a critical primer on solar cells, wind turbines, biofuels, nuclear power, clean coal, and electric cars. It also delivers three dozen first steps around the themes of environmental justice, overpopulation, rebound effects, energy economics, degrowth, taxes, bicycling, livable neighborhoods, and energy conservation.The Sunday Times describes Ozzie Zehner as "an academic who is causing shockwaves."

Now the acclaimed author who illuminated the Civil War and the Mexican-American War brilliantly brings to life the American Revolution, creating a superb saga of the men who helped to forge the destiny of a nation.</p><p>5 CDs, 6 hrs.<br>Performance by Victor Garber<br><br>RISE TO REBELLION is set in the tumultuous years leading up to the American Revolution in 1776. In chapters, narrated by a wide variety of characters both British and colonist, listeners are made to understand the complex issues and circumstances that are leading to the inevitable war. <br><br>Benjamin Franklin, the colonist's senior diplomat, is living in London in 1770 as the novel opens. In his wise observations and conversations with his British counterparts, Franklin relates the growing hunger for freedom that is building in the colonies. Already in 1770 some of the more radical of the colonists, such as Sam Adams, are doing all they can to rouse their fellow citizens to active rebellion. Others, such as John Adams, are more cautious about rushing to war, though we see their patience wear thin when they realize that the British have no intention of giving in to even their smallest demands for everyday freedoms. <br><br>RISE TO REBELLION succeeds not only by dramatizing the events of the time? The Boston Tea Party, and The Battles of Concord and Bunker Hill, most prominently ?but also by engaging us in the personal lives of the main characters. Whether it is Franklin thinking of his wife whom he has left behind in the colonies while he serves his country in London, or John Adams reflecting on the imminent birth of his son and the kind of country he is being born into, we are always struck by the power of these remarkable men to shape their times and their destinies.<br><br><b>&#x201c;A ROUSING NOVEL RECOUNTING THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Washington Times<br></i></b><br><b>&#x201c;Dazzling . . .

However, most of us are unaware how tumultuous and improbable the drafting and ratification processes were. As Benjamin Franklin keenly observed, any assembly of men bring with them "all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, and their selfish views." One need not deny that the Framers had good intentions in order to believe that they also had interests. Based on prodigious research and told largely through the voices of the participants, Michael Klarman's <em>The Framers' Coup</em> narrates how the Framers' clashing interests shaped the Constitution--and American history itself.<br><br>The Philadelphia convention could easily have been a failure, and the risk of collapse was always present. Had the convention dissolved, any number of adverse outcomes could have resulted, including civil war or a reversion to monarchy. Not only does Klarman capture the knife's-edge atmosphere of the convention, he populates his narrative with riveting and colorful stories: the rebellion of debtor farmers in Massachusetts; George Washington's uncertainty about whether to attend; Gunning Bedford's threat to turn to a European prince if the small states were denied equal representation in the Senate; slave staters' threats to take their marbles and go home if denied representation for their slaves; Hamilton's quasi-monarchist speech to the convention; and Patrick Henry's herculean efforts to defeat the Constitution in Virginia through demagoguery and conspiracy theories. <br><br><em>The Framers' Coup</em> is more than a compendium of great stories, however, and the powerful arguments that feature throughout will reshape our understanding of the nation's founding. Simply put, the Constitutional Convention almost didn't happen, and once it happened, it almost failed. Even after the convention succeeded, the Constitution it produced almost failed to be ratified. Just as importantly, the Constitution was hardly the product of philosophical reflections by brilliant, disinterested statesmen, but rather ordinary interest group politics. Multiple conflicting interests had a say, from creditors and debtors to city dwellers and backwoodsmen. The upper class overwhelmingly supported the Constitution; many working class colonists were more dubious. Slave states and nonslave states had different perspectives on how well the Constitution served their interests. <br><br>Ultimately, both the Constitution's content and its ratification process raise troubling questions about democratic legitimacy. The Federalists were eager to avoid full-fledged democratic deliberation over the Constitution, and the document that was ratified was stacked in favor of their preferences. In terms of substance, the Constitution was a significant departure from the more democratic state constitutions of the 1770s. Definitive and authoritative, <em>The Framers' Coup</em> explains why the Framers preferred such a constitution and how they managed to persuade the country to adopt it. We have lived with the consequences, both positive and negative, ever since.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael J. Klarman </strong>is Kirkland &amp; Ellis Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and author of the Bancroft Prize-winning <em>From Jim Crow to Civil Rights</em> (OUP).<br><br>"Klarman...offers a pragmatic, even quotidian, explanation, taking the reader through the most minute historical detail and presenting quite literally everything anyone interested in the coming-to-be of the US Constitution would possibly want: theory, philosophy, history, theology, religion, politics, economics-and just plain random chance. And he weaves it all together with a master storyteller's ear for just the right phrase and just the right dramatic line. This reviewer is amazed by what the author has accomplished. This is not the first thing he's written, and yet it feels like something one would spend an entire academic career writing. The documentation is astonishing, and is alone worth the price of this (extremely large!) volume. This reviewer had a grand time reading this, and cannot wait to do it again. This is an amazing piece of work....Essential"--M. Berheide, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"The central strength of this book is its deep familiarity with primary sources"--John R. Vile, <em>The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</em><p></p><br>"A magisterial history of the creation of the United States Constitution... In crisp, precise style, and without undue reverence for the framers or their handiwork, Klarman explores in great depth, with ample illustrative quotations, the varying proposals and the heated arguments for and against them... A monumental project carried off to a high degree of excellence... Constitutional scholars will find this thorough and authoritative work indispensable reading."--<em>Kirkus</em>, Starred Review<p></p><br>"Michael Klarman has written the best single-volume analysis of the flaws in the Articles of Confederation that led to the Constitutional Convention, the debate in that Convention, the ratification of the proposed Constitution, and the drafting and adoption of the Bill of Rights. With great insight, Klarman explains the complexities of America's postwar economic, political, and constitutional struggles, showing how a people who fought a long war for their rights could then approve a democracy-limiting Constitution that greatly restricted those rights. Klarman commands the documentary sources like no other historian. His page-turning narrative is equal to the epic story he unveils. Every serious scholar of the period must read this masterful work."--John Kaminski, Director, Center for the Study of the American Constitution, University of Wisconsin-Madison<p></p><br>"<em>The Framers' Coup</em> is the first comprehensive account of the entire struggle for the United States Constitution, from the inception of the amalgamating impulse in the early 1780s all the way through to the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791. A lot of us who write books about the Constitution are about to see our royalties trail off, because Michael Klarman, in a brisk narrative, deftly summarizes all the major interpretations in developing his own provocative and persuasive take. I for one will take my lumps, because this book is a beaut."--Woody Holton, Bancroft Prize winner and author of <em>Unruly Americans and the Origins of the Constitution</em><p></p><br>"At last, we have a definitive account of the entire Framing period. Klarman has brought to the task the narrative skill and situation sense of a historian, the attention to detail and language of a lawyer, and the wisdom and insight of the great scholar that he is."--Louis Michael Seidman, Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Constitutional Law, Georgetown University Law Center<p></p><br>"The fullest explanation of the origins of the Constitution that we are ever likely to get in a single volume. Klarman ably shows how an interest-ridden Constitutional Convention that was fearful of democracy nevertheless created a document that transcended those interests and became the basis for a democracy that has survived for over two centuries."--Gordon S. Wood, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</em><p></p><br>"This remarkable book tells a gripping story of how the Constitution, often lauded as principled and visionary, was the work of intensely political individuals who were preoccupied with the issues of their day but were still able to accomplish something the nation needed. If you are interested in the Constitution and you do not read this book, you are making a big mistake."--David A. Strauss, Gerald Ratner Distinguished Service Professor of Law, University of Chicago Law School<p></p><br>"In this thoroughly researched volume, Michael Klarman gives us a book that has strangely gone unwritten: a comprehensive account of the adoption of the Constitution, from the reform initiatives of the 1780s through the ratification of the first amendments in 1791. Anyone who wants to understand the origins and character of the American constitutional project will need to wrestle with Klarman's incisive and balanced judgments."--Jack Rakove, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Original Meanings</em><p></p><br>"Impressive... [Michael Klarman] digs deeper into the primary sources than any of his predecessors.. no one has so carefully sifted the constitutional debates of the entire decade of the 1780's and brought them into a single cohesive interpretation focused on economics."--<em>New Republic</em><p></p><br>"Magisterial... <em>The Framers' Coup</em> might well be the best book ever written on the founders and their handiwork. With impressive, even loving detail, and mostly emphasizing historical facts rather than his own opinions, Klarman conjures up the framers' whole world... riveting."--Cass Sunstein, <em>The</em> <em>New Rambler</em><p></p><br>"This boldly themed and fast-paced book is both comprehensive and corrective."--<em>The Harvard Law Bulletin</em><p></p><br>"The book has the authority and elegance of a reference work written for the ages...

Pat Distracted on a Tedious Art Course<br><br>Pat let her gaze move slowly round the room, over the figures seated at the table in the seminar room. There were ten of them; eleven if one counted Dr Fantouse himself, although he was exactly the sort of person one wouldn't count. Dr Fantouse, reader in the history of art and author of The Discerning Gaze in the Quattrocento was a mild, rather mousy man, who for some reason invariably evoked the pity of students. It was not that they disliked him - he was too kind and courteous for that - they just felt a vague, inexpressible regret that he existed, with his shabby jacket and his dull Paisley ties; no discernment there, one of them had said, with some satisfaction at the wit of the remark. And then there was the name, which sounded so like that marvellous, but under-used, Scots word which Pat's father used to describe the overly flashy - fantoosh. Dr Fantouse was not fantoosh in any respect; but neither was . . . Pat's gaze had gone all the way round the table, over all ten, skipping over Dr Fantouse quickly, as in sympathy, and now returned to the boy sitting opposite her.<br><br>He was called Wolf, she had discovered. At the first meeting of the class they had all introduced themselves round the table, at the suggestion of Dr Fantouse himself ("I'm Geoffrey Fantouse, as you may know; I'm the Quattrocento really, but I have a strong interest in aesthetics, which, I hardly need to remind you, is what we shall be discussing in this course"). And then had come a succession of names: Ginny, Karen, Mark, Greg, Alice, and so on until, at the end, Wolf, looking down at the table in modesty, had said, "Wolf", and Pat had seen the barely disguised appreciative glances of Karen and Ginny.<br><br>Wolf. It was a very good name for a boy, thought Pat; ideal, in fact. Wolf was a name filled with promise. And this Wolf, sitting opposite her, fitted the name perfectly. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with a shock of golden hair and a broad smile. Boys like that could look - and be - vacuous - surfing types with a limited vocabulary and an off-putting empty-headedness. But not this Wolf. There was a lambent intelligence in his face, a light in the eyes that revealed the mind behind the appealing features.<br><br>Now, at the second meeting of the seminar group, Pat struggled to follow the debate which Dr Fantouse was trying to encourage. They had been invited to consider the contention of Joseph Beuys that the distinction between what is art in the products of our human activity and what is not art, is a pernicious and pointless one. The discussion, which could have been so passionate, had never risen above the bland; there had been long silences, even after the name of Damien Hirst had been raised and Dr Fantouse, in an attempt to provoke controversy, had expressed doubts over the display of half a cow in formaldehyde. "I am not sure," he had ventured, "whether an artist of another period, let us say Donatello, would have considered this art. Butchery, maybe, or even science, but perhaps not art."<br><br>This remark had been greeted with silence. Then the thin-faced girl sitting next to Pat had spoken. "Can Damien Hirst actually draw?" she asked. "I mean, if you asked him to draw a house, would he be able to do so? Would it look like a house?"<br><br>They stared at her. "I don't see what that . . ." began a young man.<br><br>"That raises an interesting issue of representation," interrupted Dr Fantouse. "I'm not sure that the essence of art is its ability to represent. May I suggest, perhaps, that we turn to the ideas of Benedetto Croce and see whether he can throw any light on the subject. As you know, Croce believed in the existence of an aesthetic function built into, so to speak, the human mind. This function . . ."<br><br>Pat looked up at the ceiling. At the beginning of the new semester she had been filled with enthusiasm at the thought of what lay ahead. The idea of studying the history of art seemed to her to be immensely exciting - an eagerly anticipated intellectual adventure - but somehow the actual experience had failed so far to live up to her expectations. She had not foreseen these dry sessions with Dr Fantouse and the arid wastes of Croce; the long silences in the seminars; the absence of sparkle.<br><br>Of course there had been numerous adjustments in her life. She had left the flat in Scotland Street, she had said goodbye to Bruce, who had gone to London, and she had also seen off her friend and neighbour, Domenica Macdonald, who had embarked on a train from Waverley Station on the first leg of her journey to the Straits of Malacca and her anthropological project. And she had moved, too, to the new flat in Spottiswoode Street, which she now shared with three other students, all female. Those were enough changes in any life, and the starting of the course had merely added to the stress.<br><br>"You'll feel better soon," her father had said when she had phoned him to complain of the blues that seemed to have descended on her. "Blues pass." And then he had hesitated, and she had known that he had been on the verge of saying: "Of course you could come home," but had refrained from doing so. For he knew, as well as she did, that she could not go home to the family house in the Grange, to her room, which was there exactly as she had left it, because that would be conceding defeat in the face of life before she had even embarked on it. So nothing more had been said.<br><br>And now, while Dr Fantouse said something more about Benedetto Croce - remarks that were met with complete silence by the group - Pat looked across the table to where Wolf was sitting and saw that he was looking at her.<br><br>They looked at one another for a few moments, and then Wolf, for his part, slowly raised a finger to his lips, and left it there for a few seconds, looking at her as he did so. Then he mouthed something which she could not make out exactly, of course, but which seemed to her to be this: Hey there, little Red Riding Hood!<br><br>2. A Picture in a Magazine<br><br>At the end of the seminar, when Dr Fantouse had shuffled off in what can only have been disappointment and defeat, back to the Quattrocento, the students snapped shut their notebooks, yawned, scratched their heads, and made their way out of the seminar room and into the corridor. Pat had deliberately avoided looking at Wolf, but she was aware of the fact that he was slow in leaving the seminar room, having dropped something on the floor, and was busy searching for it. There was a notice-board directly outside the door, and she stopped at this, looking at the untidy collection of posters which had been pinned up by a variety of student clubs and societies. None of these was of real interest to her. She did not wish to take up gliding and had only a passing interest in salsa classes. Nor was she interested in teaching at an American summer camp, for which no experience was necessary, although enthusiasm was helpful. But at least these notices gave her an excuse to wait until Wolf came out, which he did a few moments later.<br><br>She stood quite still, peering at the small print on the summer camp poster. There was something about an orientation weekend and insurance, and then a deposit would be necessary unless . . .<br><br>"Not a nice way to spend the summer," a voice behind her said. "Hundreds of brats. No time off. Real torture."<br><br>She turned round, affecting surprise. "Yes," she said. "I wasn't really thinking of doing it."<br><br>"I had a friend who did it once," said Wolf. "He ran away. He actually physically ran away to New York after two weeks." He looked at his watch and then nodded in the direction of the door at the end of the corridor. "Are you hungry?"<br><br>Pat was not, but said that she was. "Ravenous."<br><br>"We could go up to the Elephant House," Wolf said, glancing at his watch. "We could have coffee and a sandwich."<br><br>They walked through George Square and across the wide space in front of the McEwan Hall. In one corner, their skateboards at their feet, a group of teenage boys huddled against the world, caps worn backwards, baggy, low-crotched trousers half-way down their flanks. Pat had wondered what these youths talked about and had concluded that they talked about nothing, because to talk was uncool. Perhaps Domenica could do field work outside the McEwan Hall - once she had finished with her Malacca Straits pirates - living with the skateboarders, in a little tent in the rhododendrons at the edge of the square, observing the socio-dynamics of the group, the leadership struggles, the badges of status. Would they accept her, she wondered? Or would she be viewed with suspicion, as an unwanted visitor from the adult world, the world of speech?<br><br>She found out a little bit more about Wolf as they made their way to the Elephant House. As they crossed the road at Napier's Health Food Shop, Wolf told her that his mother was an enthusiast of vitamins and homeopathic medicine. He had been fed on vitamins as a boy and had been taken to a homeopathic doctor, who gave him small doses of carefully-chosen poison. The whole family took Echinacea against colds, regularly, although they still got them.<br><br>"It keeps her happy," he said. "You know how mothers are. And it's cool by me if my mother's unstressed. You know what I mean?"<br><br>Pat thought she did. "That's cool," she said.<br><br>And then he told her that he came from Aberdeen. His father, he said, was in the oil business. He had a company which supplied valves for off-shore wells. They sold valves all over the world, and his father was often away in places like Houston and Brunei. He collected air miles which he gave to Wolf.<br><br>"I can go anywhere I want," he said. "I could go to South America, if I wanted. Tomorrow. All on air miles."<br><br>"I haven't got any air miles," said Pat.<br><br>"None at all?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>Wolf shrugged. "No big deal," he said. "You don't really need them."<br><br>"Do you think that Dr Fantouse has any air miles?" asked Pat suddenly.<br><br>They both laughed. "Definitely not," said Wolf. "Poor guy. Bus miles maybe."<br><br>Inside the Elephant House it was beginning to get busy, and they had to wait to be served. Wolf suggested that Pat should find a table while he ordered the coffee and the sandwiches.<br><br>Pat, waiting for Wolf, paged through a glossy magazine which she found in a rack on the wall. It was one of those magazines which everyone affected to despise, but which equally everyone rather enjoyed - page after page of pictures of celebrities, lounging by the side of swimming pools, leaving expensive restaurants, arriving at parties. The locales, and the clothes, were redolent of luxury, even if luxury that was in very poor taste; and the people looked rather like waxworks - propped up, prompted into positions of movement, but made of wax. This was due to the fact that the photographers caked them with make-up, somebody had explained to her. That's why they looked so artificial.<br><br>She turned a page, and stopped. There had been a party, somebody's twenty-first, at Gleneagles. Elegant girls in glittering dresses were draped about young men in formal kilt outfits, dinner jackets and florid silk bow-ties. And there was Wolf, standing beside a girl with red hair, a glass of champagne in his hand. Pat stared at the photograph. Surely it could not be him. Nobody she knew was in Hi! magazine; this was another world. But it must have been him, because there was the smile, and the hair, and that look in the eyes.<br><br>She looked up. Wolf was standing at the table, holding a tray. He laid the tray down on the table, and glanced at the magazine.<br><br>"Is this you, Wolf?" Pat asked. "Look. I can't believe that I know somebody in Hi!"<br><br>Wolf glanced at the picture and frowned. "You don't," he said. "That's not me."<br><br>Pat looked again at the picture then transferred her gaze up to Wolf. If it was not him, then it was his double.<br><br>Wolf took the magazine from her and tossed it to the other end of the table.<br><br>"I can't bear those mags," he said. "Full of nothing. Airheads."<br><br>He turned to her and smiled, showing his teeth, which were very white, and even, and which for some rather disturbing reason she wanted to touch.<br><br>3. Co-incidence in Spottiswoode Street<br><br>"Your name," said Pat to Wolf, as they sat drinking coffee in the Elephant House. "Your name intrigues me. I don't think I've met anybody called Wolf before." She paused. Perhaps it was a sore point with him; people could be funny about their names, and perhaps Wolf was embarrassed about his. "Of course, there's nothing wrong with . . ."<br><br>Wolf smiled. "Don't worry," he said. "People are often surprised when I tell them what I'm called. There's a simple explanation. It's not the name I was given at the beginning. That's . . ."<br><br>Pat waited for him to finish the sentence, but he had raised his mug of coffee to his mouth and was looking at her over the rim. His eyes, she saw, were bright, as if he was teasing her about something.<br><br>"You don't have to tell me," she said quietly.<br><br>He put down his mug. "But you do want to know, don't you?"<br><br>Pat shrugged. "Only if you want to tell me."<br><br>"All right," said Wolf. "I started out as Wilfred."<br><br>Pat felt a sudden urge to laugh, and almost did. There were more embarrassing names than that, of course - Cuthbert, for instance - but she could not see Wolf as Wilfred. There was no panache about Wilfred; none of the slight threat that went with Wolf.<br><br>"I couldn't stand being called Wilfred," Wolf went on. "And it was worse when it was shortened to Wilf. So I decided when I was about ten that I would be Wolfred, and my parents went along with that. So I was Wolfred from then on. That's the name on my student card. At school they called me Wolf. You were Patricia, I suppose?"<br><br>"Yes," said Pat.

This is the untold story of the complicated cross-border, multi-sided Civil War era specific to the Rio Grande Valley in both Texas and Mexico that took place most intensively between 1861 and 1867, yet the roots of which reach back to at least 1846 and extend forward to at least 1877.</p><p></p><h2>War Made New: Weapons, Warriors, and the Making of the Modern World</h2><p><b>A monumental, groundbreaking work, now in paperback, that shows how technological and strategic revolutions have transformed the battlefield</b> <br><br> Combining gripping narrative history with wide-ranging analysis, <i>War Made New</i> focuses on four ?revolutions? in military affairs and describes how inventions ranging from gunpowder to GPS-guided air strikes have remade the field of battle?and shaped the rise and fall of empires. <br><br> <i>War Made New</i> begins with the Gunpowder Revolution and explains warfare?s evolution from ritualistic, drawn-out engagements to much deadlier events, precipitating the rise of the modern nation-state. He next explores the triumph of steel and steam during the Industrial Revolution, showing how it powered the spread of European colonial empires. Moving into the twentieth century and the Second Industrial Revolution, Boot examines three critical clashes of World War II to illustrate how new technology such as the tank, radio, and airplane ushered in terrifying new forms of warfare and the rise of centralized, and even totalitarian, world powers. Finally, Boot focuses on the Gulf War, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the Iraq War?arguing that even as cutting-edge technologies have made America the greatest military power in world history, advanced communications systems have allowed decentralized, ?irregular? forces to become an increasingly significant threat.</p><p>Max Boot is the author of the award-winning <i>The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power</i>, which was selected as a 2002 Best Book of the Year by <i>The Washington Post</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>.

In the face of pervasive racial inequality and segregation, most white people cannot answer that question. In the second edition of this seminal text, Robin DiAngelo reveals the factors that make this question so difficult: mis-education about what racism is; ideologies such as individualism and colorblindness; segregation; and the belief that to be complicit in racism is to be an immoral person. These factors contribute to what she terms white racial illiteracy. Speaking as a white person to other white people, DiAngelo clearly and compellingly takes readers through an analysis of white socialization. Weaving research, analysis, stories, images, and familiar examples, she provides the framework needed to develop white racial literacy. She describes how race shapes the lives of white people, explains what makes racism so hard to see, identifies common white racial patterns, and speaks back to popular narratives that work to deny racism. Written as an accessible overview on white identity from an anti-racist framework, <i>What Does It Mean to Be White?</i> is an invaluable resource for members of diversity and anti-racism programs and study groups, and students of sociology, psychology, education, and other disciplines. This revised edition features two new chapters, including one on DiAngelo&#x2019;s influential concept of white fragility. Written to be accessible both within and without academia, this revised edition also features discussion questions, an index, and a glossary.</p><p>Robin DiAngelo received her PhD at the University of Washington, where she was twice honored with the Student&#x2019;s Choice Award for Educator of the Year. Her concept of white fragility has influenced the national discourse on race. She has published widely in both mainstream and academic venues.Praise for the First Edition of <i>What Does It Mean to Be White?</i>: <br> �Rarely will one find an analysis of whiteness (and the problems associated with it) that is as comprehensive as this one. From incisive and wide-ranging critiques of how white folks deflect, deny, and evade the topic of racism, and the implications of our own racial identity and position, to an absolutely on-point interrogation of how racism and whiteness influence white teachers-in-training, and thus, the larger educational process, Robin DiAngelo demonstrates the kind of clarity of thought so needed on this important subject.� (Tim Wise, Author of <i>White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son</i> and <i>Dear White America: Letter to a New Minority</i>)</p><h2>A Memoir of the Warsaw Uprising (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>On August 1, 1944, Miron Bia&#x142;oszewski, later to gain renown as one of Poland&#x2019;s most innovative poets, went out to run an errand for his mother and ran into history. With Soviet forces on the outskirts of Warsaw, the Polish capital revolted against five years of Nazi occupation, an uprising that began in a spirit of heroic optimism. Sixty-three days later it came to a tragic end. The Nazis suppressed the insurgents ruthlessly, reducing Warsaw to rubble while slaughtering some 200,000 people, mostly through mass executions. The Red Army simply looked on.<br><br>Bia&#x142;oszewski&#x2019;s blow-by-blow account of the uprising brings it alive in all its desperate urgency. Here we are in the shoes of a young man slipping back and forth under German fire, dodging sniper bullets, collapsing with exhaustion, rescuing the wounded, burying the dead. An indispensable and unforgettable act of witness,&nbsp;<i>A Memoir of the Warsaw Uprising</i>&nbsp;is also a major work of literature. Bia&#x142;oszewski writes in short, stabbing, splintered, breathless sentences attuned to &#x201c;the glaring identity of &#x2018;now.&#x2019;&#x201d; His pages are full of a white-knuckled poetry that resists the very destruction it records.<br><br>Madeline G. Levine has extensively revised her 1977 translation, and passages that were unpublishable in Communist Poland have been restored.</p><p><b>Miron Bia&#x142;oszewski </b>(1922&#x2013;1983) was born in Warsaw, the son of a postal clerk. During the German occupation of Poland in World War II, he studied Polish literature in an underground school, though he never obtained any kind of degree. Not a combatant, he was deported to a German work camp following the Warsaw Uprising, escaped after a month and, as the war drew to its end, returned to his devastated city. Bia&#x142;oszewski worked as a journalist, writing poetry at night, though it was not until 1956 that his first volume of poetry, <i>Obroty rzeczy</i> (<i>The Revolution of Things</i>), appeared to great acclaim. Additional volumes of poetry and short prose texts followed, while Bia&#x142;oszewski also wrote plays for and acted with the collaborative and experimental Tarczy&#x144;ska Street Theater. <i>A Memoir of the Warsaw Uprising</i> came out in 1970.<br><b><br>Madeline G.

Sallust adopts the usually accepted view of Catiline, and describes him as the deliberate foe of law, order and morality, and does not give a comprehensive explanation of his views and intentions. Catiline had supported the party of Sulla, to which Sallust was opposed. Sallust&#39;s &#34;Jugurthine War&#34; is a valuable and interesting monograph. We may assume that Sallust collected materials and put together notes for it during his governorship of Numidia. Here, too, he dwells upon the feebleness of the senate and aristocracy.</p><p><b>Sallust&nbsp;</b>(Gaius Sallustius Crispus), (86-34 BC), was a Roman historian.

The two enjoy a series of adventures, accidentally witnessing a murder, establishing the innocence of the man wrongly accused, as well as being hunted by Injun Joe, the true murderer, eventually escaping and finding the treasure that Joe had buried. Huckleberry Finn recounts the further adventures of Huck, who runs away from a drunken and brutal father, and meets up with the escaped slave Jim. They float down the Mississippi on a raft, participating in the lives of the characters they meet, witnessing corruption, moral decay and intellectual impoverishment. Sharing so much in background and character, these two stories, the best of Twain, indisputably belong together in one volume. Though originally written as adventure stories for young people, the vivid writing provides a profound commentary on provincial American life in the mid-nineteenth century and the institution of slavery.</p><p>As part of the wonderful Collector's Library Series, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of the best-loved children's classics of all time.This attractive volume contains the complete and unabridged story with 8 full color illustrations, plus numerous black &amp; white illustrations throughout.

This Library of America volume, prepared by Niebuhr&#x2019;s daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, collects four indispensable books: <i>Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic</i> (1929),<i>Moral Man and Immoral Society</i> (1932), <i>The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness</i> (1944), and<i>The Irony of American History</i> (1952), along with a selection of essays, sermons, lectures, prayers, including his world-famous Serenity Prayer, and writings on current eventsProhibition, the Allied bombing of Germany, apartheid in South Africa, the Vietnam Warmany of which are collected here for the first time.<b><b>REINHOLD NIEBUHR </b></b>(1892-1971)&nbsp;began his career as a young pastor in Detroit. By 1928, when he moved to New York City to take a position at the Union Theological Seminary, he was a committed pacifist, and ran for Congress in 1932 as a Socialist.&nbsp;Breaking with his pacifist and socialist associates shortly after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, he articulated a realist political philosophy that aligned with his ever-evolving theology. Niebuhr&#x2019;s thinking has influenced American culture in profound ways, whether through the simple but powerful &#x201c;Serenity Prayer&#x201d; known to millions or via the influence of his writings on social and political figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Barack Obama.<b><br><br>ELISABETH SIFTON</b>, an editor and book publisher for forty years, is the author of <i>The Serenity Prayer: Faith and Politics in Times of Peace and War</i>.

He is a translator and art critic.</p></p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>Demian: The Story of a Youth</h2><p>2011 Reprint of 1948 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The main character of this classic novel, Emil Sinclair, is a young boy raised in a bourgeois home, amidst what is described as a Scheinwelt, a play on words that means &#34;world of light&#34; as well as &#34;world of illusion&#34;. Emil&#39;s entire existence can be summarized as a struggle between two worlds: the show world of illusion (related to the Hindu concept of maya) and the real world, the world of spiritual truth. In the course of the novel, accompanied and prompted by his mysterious classmate &#39;Max Demian&#39;, he detaches from and revolts against the superficial ideals of the world of appearances and eventually awakens into a realization of self. The novel refers to the idea of Gnosticism, particularly the god Abraxas, showing the influence of Carl Jung&#39;s psychology. According to Hesse, the novel is a story of Jungian individuation, the process of opening up to one&#39;s unconsciousness.</p><p></p><h2>Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry</h2><p>Before I say anything about this book, I offer for your consideration the fact that I am not a student of biochemistry; I am a physics graduate student.

Sometimes, my candle scarcely out, my eyes would close so quickly that I did not have time to say to myself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m falling asleep.&#x201d; And, half an hour later, the thought that it was time to try to sleep would wake me; I wanted to put down the book I thought I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I had not ceased while sleeping to form reflec-tions on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Fran�ois I and Charles V. This belief lived on for a few seconds after my waking; it did not shock my reason but lay heavy like scales on my eyes and kept them from realizing that the candlestick was no longer lit. Then it began to grow unintelligible to me, as after metempsychosis do the thoughts of an earlier existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I recovered my sight and I was amazed to find a darkness around me soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, to which it appeared a thing without cause, incomprehensible, a thing truly dark. I would ask myself what time it might be; I could hear the whistling of the trains which, remote or nearby, like the singing of a bird in a forest, plotting the distances, described to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveler hastens toward the nearest station; and the little road he is following will be engraved on his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unaccustomed ctivities, to the recent conversation and the farewells under the unfamiliar lamp that follow him still through the silence of the night, to the imminent sweetness of his return.<p>I would rest my cheeks tenderly against the lovely cheeks of the pillow, which, full and fresh, are like the cheeks of our childhood. I would strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. This is the hour when the invalid who has been obliged to go off on a journey and has had to sleep in an unfamiliar hotel, wakened by an attack, is cheered to see a ray of light under the door. How fortunate, it&#x2019;s already morning! In a moment the servants will be up, he will be able to ring, someone will come help him. The hope of being relieved gives him the courage to suffer. In fact he thought he heard footsteps; the steps approach, then recede. And the ray of light that was under his door has disappeared. It is midnight; they have just turned off the gas; the last servant has gone and he will have to suffer the whole night through without remedy.</p><p>I would go back to sleep, and would sometimes afterward wake again for brief moments only, long enough to hear the organic creak of the woodwork, open my eyes and stare at the kaleidoscope of the darkness, savor in a momentary glimmer of consciousness the sleep into which were plunged the furniture, the room, that whole of which I was only a small part and whose insensibility I would soon return to share. Or else while sleeping I had effortlessly returned to a period of my early life that had ended forever, rediscovered one of my childish terrors such as my great-uncle pulling me by my curls, a terror dispelled on the day&#x2014;the dawn for me of a new era&#x2014;when they were cut off. I had forgotten that event during my sleep, I recovered its memory as soon as I managed to wake myself up to escape the hands of my great-uncle, but as a precautionary measure I would completely surround my head with my pillow before returning to the world of dreams.</p><p>Sometimes, as Eve was born from one of Adam&#x2019;s ribs, a woman was born during my sleep from a cramped position of my thigh. Formed from the pleasure I was on the point of enjoying, she, I imagined, was the one offering it to me. My body, which felt in hers my own warmth, would try to find itself inside her, I would wake up. The rest of humanity seemed very remote compared with this woman I had left scarcely a few moments before; my cheek was still warm from her kiss, my body aching from the weight of hers. If, as sometimes happened, she had the features of a woman I had known in life, I would devote myself entirely to this end: to finding her again, like those who go off on a journey to see a longed-for city with their own eyes and imagine that one can enjoy in reality the charm of a dream. Little by little the memory of her would fade, I had forgotten the girl of my dream.</p><p>A sleeping man holds in a circle around him the sequence of the hours, the order of the years and worlds. He consults them instinctively as he wakes and reads in a second the point on the earth he occupies, the time that has elapsed before his waking; but their ranks can be mixed up, broken. If toward morning, after a bout of insomnia, sleep overcomes him as he is reading, in a position quite different from the one in which he usually sleeps, his raised arm alone is enough to stop the sun and make it retreat, and, in the first minute of his waking, he will no longer know what time it is, he will think he has only just gone to bed. If he dozes off in a position still more displaced and divergent, after dinner sitting in an armchair for instance, then the confusion among the disordered worlds will be complete, the magic armchair will send him traveling at top speed through time and space, and, at the moment of opening his eyelids, he will believe he went to bed several months earlier in another country. But it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was deep and allowed my mind to relax entirely; then it would let go of the map of the place where I had fallen asleep and, when I woke in the middle of the night, since I did not know where I was, I did not even understand in the first moment who I was; I had only, in its original simplicity, the sense of existence as it may quiver in the depths of an animal; I was more destitute than a cave dweller; but then the memory&#x2014;not yet of the place where I was, but of several of those where I had lived and where I might have been&#x2014;would come to me like help from on high to pull crossed centuries of civilization in one second, and the image confusedly glimpsed of oil lamps, then of wing-collar shirts, gradually recomposed my self&#x2019;s original features.</p><p>Perhaps the immobility of the things around us is imposed on them by our certainty that they are themselves and not anything else, by the immobility of our mind confronting them. However that may be, when I woke thus, my mind restlessly attempting, without success, to discover where I was, everything revolved around me in the darkness, things, countries, years. My body, too benumbed to move, would try to locate, according to the form of its fatigue, the position of its limbs so as to deduce from this the direction of the wall, the placement of the furniture, so as to reconstruct and name the dwelling in which it found itself. Its memory, the memory of its ribs, its knees, its shoulders, offered in succession several of the rooms where it had slept, while around it the invisible walls, changing place according to the shape of the imagined room, spun through the shadows. And even before my mind, hesitating on the thresholds of times and shapes, had identified the house by reassembling the circumstances, it&#x2014;my body&#x2014;would recall the kind of bed in each one, the location of the doors, the angle at which the light came in through the windows, the existence of a hallway, along with the thought I had had as I fell asleep and that I had recovered upon waking. My stiffened side, trying to guess its orientation, would imagine, for instance, that it lay facing the wall in a big canopied bed and immediately I would say to myself: &#x201c;Why, I went to sleep in the end even though Mama didn&#x2019;t come to say goodnight to me,&#x201d; I was in the country in the home of my grandfather, dead for many years; and my body, the side on which I was resting, faithful guardians of a past my mind ought never to have forgotten, recalled to me the flame of the night-light of Bohemian glass, in the shape of an urn, which hung from the ceiling by little chains, the mantelpiece of Siena marble, in my bedroom at Combray, at my grandparents&#x2019; house, in faraway days which at this moment I imagined were present without picturing them to myself exactly and which I would see more clearly in a little while when I was fully awake.</p><p>Then the memory of a new position would reappear; the wall would slip away in another direction: I was in my room at Mme. de Saint-Loup&#x2019;s, in the country; good Lord! It&#x2019;s ten o&#x2019;clock or even later, they will have finished dinner! I must have overslept during the nap I take every evening when I come back from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before putting on my evening clothes. For many years have passed since Combray, where, however late we returned, it was the sunset&#x2019;s red reflections I saw in the panes of my window. It is another sort of life one leads at Tansonville, at Mme. de Saint-Loup&#x2019;s, another sort of pleasure I take in going out only at night, in following by moonlight those lanes where I used to play in the sun; and the room where I fell asleep instead of dressing for dinner&#x2014;from far off I can see it, as we come back, pierced by the flares of the lamp, a lone beacon in the night.</p><p>These revolving, confused evocations never lasted for more than a few seconds; often, in my brief uncertainty about where I was, I did not distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed any better than we isolate, when we see a horse run, the successive positions shown to us by a kinetoscope. But I had seen sometimes one, sometimes another, of the bedrooms I had inhabited in my life, and in the end I would recall them all in the long reveries that followed my waking: winter bedrooms in which, as soon as you are in bed, you bury your head in a nest braided of the most disparate things: a corner of the pillow, the top of the covers, a bit of shawl, the side of the bed and an issue of the D�bats roses,1 which you end by cementing together using the birds&#x2019; technique of pressing down on it indefinitely; where in icy weather the pleasure you enjoy is the feeling that you are separated from the outdoors (like the sea swallow which makes its nest deep in an underground passage in the warmth of the earth) and where, since the fire is kept burning all night in the fireplace, you sleep in a great cloak of warm, smoky air, shot with the glimmers from the logs breaking into flame again, a sort of immaterial alcove, a warm cave dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat with shifting thermal contours, aerated by drafts which cool your face and come from the corners, from the parts close to the window or far from the hearth, and which have grown cold again: summer bedrooms where you delight in becoming one with the soft night, where the moonlight leaning against the half-open shutters casts its enchanted ladder to the foot of the bed, where you sleep almost in the open air, like a titmouse rocked by the breeze on the tip of a ray of light; sometimes the Louis XVI bedroom, so cheerful that even on the first night I had not been too unhappy there and where the slender columns that lightly supported the ceiling stood aside with such grace to show and reserve the place where the bed was; at other times, the small bedroom with the very high ceiling, hollowed out in the form of a pyramid two stories high and partly paneled in mahogany, where from the first second I had been mentally poisoned by the unfamiliar odor of the vetiver, convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and the insolent indifference of the clock chattering loudly as though I were not there; where a strange and pitiless quadrangular cheval glass, barring obliquely one of the corners of the room, carved from deep inside the soft fullness of my usual field of vision a site for itself which I had not expected; where my mind, struggling for hours to dislodge itself, to stretch upward so as to assume the exact shape of the room and succeed in filling its gigantic funnel to the very top, had suffered many hard nights, while I lay stretched out in my bed, my eyes lifted, my ear anxious, my nostril restive, my heart pounding, until habit had changed the color of the curtains, silenced the clock, taught pity to the cruel oblique mirror, concealed, if not driven out completely, the smell of the vetiver and appreciably diminished the apparent height of the ceiling. Habit! That skillful but very slow housekeeper who begins by letting our mind suffer for weeks in a temporary arrangement; but whom we are nevertheless truly happy to discover, for without habit our mind, reduced to no more than its own resources, would be powerless to make a lodging habitable.</p><p>Certainly I was now wide-awake, my body had veered around one last time and the good angel of certainty had brought everything around me to a standstill, laid me down under my covers, in my bedroom, and put approximately where they belonged in the darkness my chest of drawers, my desk, my fireplace, the window onto the street and the two doors. But even though I knew I was not in any of the houses of which my ignorance upon waking had instantly, if not presented me with the distinct picture, at least made me believe the presence possible, my memory had been stirred; generally I would not try to go back to sleep right away; I would spend the greater part of the night remembering our life in the old days, in Combray at my great-aunt&#x2019;s house, in Balbec, in Paris, in Donci�res, in Venice, elsewhere still, remembering the places, the people I had known there, what I had seen of them, what I had been told about them.</p><p>At Combray, every day, in the late afternoon, long before the moment when I would have to go to bed and stay there, without sleeping, far away from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom again became the fixed and painful focus of my preoccupations. They had indeed hit upon the idea, to distract me on the evenings when they found me looking too unhappy, of giving me a magic lantern, which, while awaiting the dinner hour, they would set on top of my lamp; and, after the fashion of the first architects and master glaziers of the Gothic age, it replaced the opacity of the walls with impalpable iridescences, supernatural multicolored apparitions, where legends were depicted as in a wavering, momentary stained-glass window. But my sadness was only increased by this since the mere change in lighting destroyed the familiarity which my bedroom had acquired for me and which, except for the torment of going to bed, had made it tolerable to me. Now I no longer recognized it and I was uneasy there, as in a room in some hotel or &#x201c;chalet&#x201d; to which I had come for the first time straight from the railway train.</p><p>Moving at the jerky pace of his horse, and filled with a hideous design, Golo would come out of the small triangular forest that velveted the hillside with dark green and advance jolting toward the castle of poor Genevi�ve de Brabant. This castle was cut off along a curved line that was actually the edge of one of the glass ovals arranged in the frame which you slipped between the grooves of the lantern. It was only a section of castle and it had a moor in front of it where Genevi�ve stood dreaming, wearing a blue belt. The c...</p></p><h2>The New Annotated H. P.

P. Lovecraft</em>. &nbsp;Despite this nearly unprecedented posthumous trajectory, at the time of his death at the age of forty-six, Lovecraft's work had appeared only in dime-store magazines, ignored by the public and maligned by critics. Now well over a century after his birth, Lovecraft is increasingly being recognized as the foundation for American horror and science fiction, the source of "incalculable influence on succeeding generations of writers of horror fiction" (Joyce Carol Oates). <p>In this volume, Leslie S. Klinger reanimates Lovecraft with clarity and historical insight, charting the rise of the erstwhile pulp writer, whose rediscovery and reclamation into the literary canon can be compared only to that of Poe or Melville. Weaving together a broad base of existing scholarship with his own original insights, Klinger appends Lovecraft's uncanny oeuvre and Kafkaesque life story in a way that provides context and unlocks many of the secrets of his often cryptic body of work.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Lovecraft&#x2015;"the Copernicus of the horror story" (Fritz Leiber)&#x2015;made a marked departure from the gothic style of his predecessors that focused mostly on ghosts, ghouls, and witches, instead crafting a vast mythos in which humanity is but a blissfully unaware speck in a cosmos shared by vast and ancient alien beings. One of the progenitors of "weird fiction,"&nbsp;Lovecraft wrote stories suggesting that we share not just our reality but our planet, and even a common ancestry, with unspeakable, godlike creatures just one accidental revelation away from emerging from their epoch of hibernation and extinguishing both our individual sanity and entire civilization.</p><p>Following his best-selling <em>The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes</em>, Leslie S.

With nearly 300 illustrations, including full-color reproductions of the original artwork and covers from <em>Weird Tales</em> and <em>Astounding Stories</em>, and more than 1,000 annotations, this volume illuminates every dimension of H.

(Hoover Institution Press Publication)</h2><p>Walter E. Williams applies an economic analysis to the problems black Americans have faced in the past and still face in the present to show that that free-market resource allocation, as opposed to political allocation, is in the best interests of minorities. He debunks many common labor market myths and reveals how excessive government regulation and the minimum-wage law have imposed incalculable harm on the most disadvantaged members of our society.</p><p><p>The black experience in America naturally gives rise to thinking of today&#x2019;s black experience in terms of racism and oppression. But the most difficult problems black Americans face, particularly those who are poor, cannot adequately be explained by<i></i>current racial discrimination.<i></i>In<i> Race and Economics, </i>Walter Williams argues that many problems are a result of policies, regulations, and restrictions emanat�ing from federal, state, and local govern�ments. It is not free markets and the profit motive that have reduced opportunities, the author asserts; instead, it is the power of vested interest groups, as a means to greater wealth, to use the coercive powers of government to stifle market competition.</p><p>Williams debunks many common labor market myths and reveals how the minimum- wage law has imposed incalculable harm on the most disadvantaged members of our society. He explains that the real problem is people are not so much underpaid as underskilled and that the real task is to help unskilled people become skilled. The author also reveals how licensing and regulation reduce economic opportunities for people, especially those who might be described as discriminated against and having little political clout. Using the example of the trucking industry before and after deregulation, he illustrates how government regulation closes entry and reinforces economic handicaps, whereas deregulation not only has helped minorities enter an industry in greater numbers, but also has benefited consumers.</p><p>People will not engage in activities, including racial discrimination, says Williams, if the cost is too high. In markets, because transactions are mostly an individual affair, it is unnecessary to win the approval or permission of others; the costs and benefits are a private matter. But in the political arena, each citizen has only one vote, meaning that, unlike the free market, a minority cannot register the intensity of his preference. Further, increased concentration of political power at the national level handicaps minorities in the sense that their votes become diluted. The author ultimately shows that free-market allocation, not political allocation, is what is truly in the best interests of minorities in America.</p><p>There is no question that black Americans have suffered gross violations of basic human rights in the forms of slavery, discrimination, and personal violence. But, says Walter Williams, an acknowledgment of these injustices, and of current residual discrimination, does not help to evaluate what is, or is not in the best interest of blacks today. In <i>Race and Economics,</i> Williams applies an economic analysis to the problems black Americans have faced in the past and present to show that that free-market resource allocation, as opposed to political allocation, is in the best interests of minorities.</p><p>Contrasting the features of market resource allocation with those of the political arena, he explains how, in the political arena, minorities cannot realize a particular preference unless they win the will of the majority. In the market, he shows, there is a sort of parity (nonexistent in the political arena) in which one person&#x2019;s dollar has the same power as the next person&#x2019;s. Looking at the effects of political decision making in areas such as minimum-wage laws, occupational and business licensure, and industry regulation versus deregulation, Williams offers evidence that government attempts to help minorities actually reduce economic opportunities for people, especially those who might be described as discriminated against and having little political clout. Ultimately, he says, people can offset some of their handicaps by offering a higher price for what they buy or a lower price for what they sell&#x2014;what economists call <i>compen�sating</i><i>differences</i>.</p></p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers (AP Edition)</h2><p>As a market leader, PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS is one of the most powerful brands in the physics market.

The focus of this acclaimed book, newly available in paperback in celebration of her life&#39;s achievement, is the artist&#39;s creative process in various different media - oil, gouache, pencil and collage.While Fedden is often considered almost exclusively a still-life painter, still life was far from being her only preoccupation, as this book shows. Fantasy and imagination always also played a strong part, as is particularly evident in her small gouaches. A quietly surreal, enigmatic streak runs through much of her work.Fedden&#39;s collages are a witty and affectionate homage to the work of her husband, Julian Trevelyan. They lived, worked and travelled together from 1949 to 1988. The book re-emphasises her debt to him, but also her independence, even during their early life together when he stimulated her move into Modernism. In an engaging text, which draws on numerous conversations with the artist during her final years, Christopher Andreae considers why Fedden has always had such a popular following, looks at the English quality of her work, and talks about the commercialisation of her art and her attitudes to the art market. Fedden is shown to be an original, serious and prolific artist, a draftsman of unusual sensitivity and prowess, and a colourist of power and subtlety.Profusely illustrated with works from private and public collections, this is a book for Mary Fedden&#39;s existing devotees as well as newcomers to her work. &#39;This book is a delight...&#39; RA Magazine</p><p>Christopher Andreae has written about art since the early 1960s.

Here the renowned analytical psychologist Erich Neumann draws on ritual, mythology, art, and records of dreams and fantasies to examine how this archetype has been outwardly expressed in many cultures and periods since prehistory. He shows how the feminine has been represented as goddess, monster, gate, pillar, tree, moon, sun, vessel, and every animal from snakes to birds. Neumann discerns a universal experience of the maternal as both nurturing and fearsome, an experience rooted in the dialectical relation of growing consciousness, symbolized by the child, to the unconscious and the unknown, symbolized by the Great Mother.</p><p>Featuring a new foreword by Martin Liebscher, this Princeton Classics edition of <i>The Great Mother</i> introduces a new generation of readers to this profound and enduring work.</p></p><p><b>Erich Neumann</b> (1905&#x2013;60), a psychologist and philosopher, was born in Berlin and lived in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death.

Although it lasted only twenty-four years (1933-1957) and enrolled fewer than 1,200 students, Black Mountain College launched a remarkable number of the artists who spearheaded the avant-garde in America of the 1960s. The faculty included such diverse talents as Anni and Josef Albers, Eric Bentley, Ilya Bolotowsky, Robert Creeley, Willem de Kooning, Robert Duncan, Lyonel Feininger, Paul Goodman, Walter Gropius, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and Charles Olson. Among the students were Ruth Asawa, John Chamberlain, Francine du Plessix Gray, Kenneth Noland, Arthur Penn, Robert Rauschenberg, Kenneth Snelson, Cy Twombly, Stan Vanderbeek, and Jose Yglesias. In this definitive account of the arts at Black Mountain College, back in print after many years, Mary Emma Harris describes a unique educational experiment and the artists and writers who conducted it. She replaces the myth of the college as a haphazardly conceived venture with a portrait of a consciously directed liberal arts school that grew out of the progressive education movement. Proceeding chronologically through the four major periods of the college's history, Harris covers every aspect of its extraordinary curriculum in the visual, literary, and performing arts.</p></p><p>Independent scholar Mary Emma Harris is Chair and Director of the Black Mountain College Project.Launched in the depths of the Depression, Black Mountain College had fewer than 1300 pupils over its 24-year lifespan. Yet this haven of experimentation in the North Carolina hills counted among its students and faculty Franz Kline, Walter Gropius, Josef Albers, Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, Robert De Niro, Buckminster Fuller, Merce Cunningham and Willem de Kooning, among others. Based on some 300 interviews as well as primary sources, this revealing study by an art historian traces the school's evolution from a small, innovative liberal arts college with a general curriculum to a creative community of practicing artists. Despite bitter internal conflicts and a certain insularity, Black Mountain risked constant financial worries to maintain a democratic openness and willingness to "let things happen." This attractively illustrated chronicle documents the gamut of creativity, from painting to weaving, ceramics, dance, graphic arts and photography. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Collaborative Intelligence: Thinking with People Who Think Differently</h2><p><b>A breakthrough book on the transformative power of collaborative thinking</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Collaborative intelligence, or CQ, is a measure of our ability to think with others on behalf of what matters to us all. It is emerging as a new professional currency at a time when the way we think, interact, and innovate is shifting. In the past, &#x201c;market share&#x201d; companies ruled by hierarchy and topdown leadership. Today, the new market leaders are &#x201c;mind share&#x201d; companies, where influence is more important than power, and success relies on collaboration and the ability to inspire.<br> <i><br>Collaborative Intelligence</i> is the culmination of more than fifty years of original research that draws on Dawna Markova&#x2019;s background in cognitive neuroscience and her most recent work, with Angie McArthur, as a &#x201c;Professional Thinking Partner&#x201d; to some of the world&#x2019;s top CEOs and creative professionals. Markova and McArthur are experts at getting brilliant yet difficult people to think together. They have been brought in to troubleshoot for Fortune 500 leaders in crisis and managers struggling to inspire their teams.<br><br>When asked about their biggest challenges at work, Markova and McArthur&#x2019;s clients all cite a common problem: <i>other people</i>. This response reflects the way we have been taught to focus on the gulfs between us rather than valuing our intellectual diversity&#x2014;that is, the ways in which each of us is uniquely gifted, how we process information and frame questions, what kind of things deplete us, and what engages and inspires us. Through a series of practices and strategies, the authors teach us how to recognize our own mind patterns and map the talents of our teams, with the goal of embarking together on an aligned course of action and influence.<br><br>In Markova and McArthur&#x2019;s experience, managers who appreciate intellectual diversity will lead their teams to innovation; employees who understand it will thrive because they are in touch with their strengths; and an entire team who understands it will come together to do their best work in a symphony of collaboration, their individual strengths working in harmony like an orchestra or a high-performing sports team.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Collaborative Intelligence</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Rooted in the latest neuroscience on the nature of collaboration, <i>Collaborative Intelligence</i> celebrates the power of working and thinking together at the highest levels of business and politics, and in the smallest aspects of our everyday lives.

A clever village elder created a small bamboo cage and placed a banana inside it, then hung it on the edge of his property. Late that afternoon, a monkey reached in and grabbed the banana. When he tried to pull it out between the narrow ribs of the cage, his hand was stuck. All he had to do to get free was to release the banana and slide his little hand out. But that evening, when the elder came to check the trap, the monkey was hanging from it, still clutching that banana, even though it meant the loss of his own freedom.<br><br>Many of us are just like that monkey. We grasp on to something that tantalizes us, and even when we realize that to be free we have to let go, we hold on nonetheless. One of the things that most commonly trap us is the habitual pattern of our own thinking&#x2014;the limiting stories we tell ourselves about who we are and what our capacities are.<br><br>Strategy 1<br><br>Mind Patterns<br><br>Thinking about Thinking<br><br>Recognizing How Your Mind Works<br><br>Each mind has its own method.<br><br>&#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson<br><br>I never heard my father say, &#x201c;I love you.&#x201d; He said many things to me in his lifetime, but never that. My mother collected newspaper clippings that chronicled his journey from inner-city street fighter to CEO of a major Chicago corporation. He often said he regretted never having a son who could inherit the knowledge he&#x2019;d gathered as he climbed the corporate ladder. My father lacked one skill, however, and it was his greatest secret and most profound shame. Every day after school I would go to his huge office. My feet would leave prints in the plush burgundy carpeting as I approached his immense mahogany desk and pulled myself up onto the leather swivel chair. The only things on the shining desktop were a large reel-to-reel tape recorder and a very thick pile of documents held in place by a crystal paperweight carved with the company insignia. Day after day, I pushed the button on the tape recorder and began to read the papers, one by one, into the microphone. Then, when I had finished, I slipped my hand under the big black-and-green blotter and found the quarter my father had left me so I could buy a hot fudge sundae on the way home. No one ever found out about this ritual. It was our secret. No one ever found out that he couldn&#x2019;t read a word.<br><br>During the ten years I read and recorded for my father in his office, our conversations grew deeper and more engaging: We actually became thinking partners. He loved my questions, and I loved learning how he managed to inspire so many people. He explained to me that in a leader, no quality was more important than the ability to recognize and develop the capacity of each person, the particular way he or she brings value to the world. As I write this, his words still resonate: &#x201c;Remember this secret, Dawna: Talent attracts capital far more than capital attracts talent.&#x201d;<br><br>I knew my father was intelligent in specific ways. As I became increasingly curious about why my father&#x2014;a man who could stand before a thousand people and deliver a speech, who could &#x201c;read&#x201d; the gifts of all of his employees&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t read, I was driven to understand how his mind worked.<br><br>The notion that we use different &#x201c;operating systems&#x201d; to think has been at the center of my work for the last fifty years. I uncovered it in the 1970s while I was shuttling back and forth from graduate school at Columbia to a classroom in Harlem, where I was teaching forty kids, many with rat bites on their cheeks and folders full of labels about how they were disabled. I adored these children. Each one was a precious riddle that asked, &#x201c;What can be possible for this child?&#x201d;<br><br>Then I met a lanky researcher at NYU named E. Roy John, who was measuring certain brain-wave frequencies associated with general psychological processes. He originated a field of study called neurometrics, which used a computer and an EEG to monitor what was going on in the brain while a person was thinking. Meanwhile, I was searching for the best reading method to use with my students: the sight method, phonics, or an experiential approach. I brought several children to his lab and connected them to his equipment. What I observed, to put it simply, was that if I gave Johnny written information to look at, his brain produced more beta waves, indicating he was concentrating. But when I gave Jimmy the same information, his brain produced more alpha waves, which indicated a daydream state. Even more confusing was that when I presented the same visual information to Jason, his brain produced more theta waves, which is a very spaced-out state. How could this be? The kind of input was determining the kind of attention that each student&#x2019;s brain was producing. I brought in more children and shifted to auditory input&#x2014;sounds and verbal words. When she was listening or talking, Jenny&#x2019;s brain got very focused, but Jessie&#x2019;s daydreamed, and Julia&#x2019;s spaced out completely. Now my confusion opened up into curiosity. I tried kinesthetic input, having the kids play with clay and move around. For some children, this produced more beta waves; for others, more alpha waves; and for still others, more theta waves. What I hadn&#x2019;t realized until that point was: 1) Input from the outside caused the children&#x2019;s brains to shift from focused attention to a daydream or creative state. Their different states of attention were being produced by the different kinds of input they were exposed to. 2) There is no one way of &#x201c;paying attention.&#x201d; The brain uses all three states to learn and think.<br><br>Through this and other experiences, I became convinced that the question is not &#x201c;Are you smart?&#x201d; but &#x201c;How are you smart?&#x201d; This awareness, coupled with the work I was studying on shifting states of attention in clinical hypnotherapy, led me to create a system for understanding different patterns of thinking, learning, and communicating, which I call &#x201c;mind patterns.&#x201d; Tens of thousands of individuals around the world now use this model in education, business, and family relationships to learn and collaborate more effectively.<br><br>The first strategy of CQ is recognizing mind patterns. This chapter and the next are the planks you will lay to help bridge differences between you and your intellectually diverse colleagues. Initially, you need to learn how to recognize the unique and specific way you process information. Knowing this will make learning, unlearning, digesting, and expressing information more natural. It will also help you design a working environment and develop new habits that evoke your best thinking. This understanding will challenge you to open your mind and grow your natural curiosity and capacity.<br><br>This information is meant to increase your curiosity about and your awareness of how you are affected by different experiences and how you can be most effective with others. It is based on what is called &#x201c;theory-in-use and action research,&#x201d; meaning that neuroscientists haven&#x2019;t yet definitively pinpointed how the brain processes information, but we can make observations and hypotheses based on extensive experience in the field. This knowledge will increase your awareness of the conditions that maximize how you think, learn, and communicate. It does not describe personality (although many of the characteristics of a person&#x2019;s mind pattern are often incorrectly attributed to that). Identifying the particular sequence your mind uses to shift attention will enable you to notice how your and other people&#x2019;s thinking is affected by different kinds of input.<br><br>At the back of the book, there is an appendix with more-detailed information on how to use your mind pattern in many work situations and a guide for how you can best interact and communicate with other patterns.<br><br>As thinkers, all of us are stuck in our own ruts and habits, and we are reluctant to move beyond them. You need to know how to create the conditions where you can let go and open up to what can be possible. You need to learn&#x2014;and unlearn&#x2014;with others constantly. This can be more challenging than it seems. One thing that distinguishes a boss from a leader is the ability to suspend belief and disbelief so that innovations and new processes will have a chance to emerge. In the beginning, all of our clients identified themselves as open-minded people, but not one of them understood the specific combination of conditions that was necessary to open his or her own mind.<br><br>How Do You Pay Attention to Attention?<br><br>The first step in recognizing your mind pattern is noticing your attention and then coming to understand its three different states and what triggers each one. Attention literally means how we attend to things, what we notice in the world we inhabit and the people we encounter. It regulates the flow of information within and between us. It is fluid. We can all aim it, follow it, or shift it, but each of us does that in a different way.<br><br>Attention, like water, has several different &#x201c;forms&#x201d; or states. It can be &#x201c;focused,&#x201d; or solid as a cube of ice. This is a state where you give your attention to only one thing and ignore the rest of what is going on around you. Attention can also be in a &#x201c;sorting&#x201d; or mediating state, shifting from inner awareness to outer and back again, sorting and digesting information. You may experience this as confusion or weighing two options, such as, &#x201c;On the one hand . . . but on the other hand . . .&#x201d; Attention can also be &#x201c;open,&#x201d; creative, daydreaming, and diffuse, where you get in touch with memories, images, and ideas and transform them into new patterns, thoughts, or insights. For instance, think of a time when you were in the shower and an idea just &#x201c;popped&#x201d; into your mind, or you had an &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s explore each state in more detail:<br><br>1. Focused Attention<br><br>This describes the conscious state of mind where your brain is producing more beta waves. Your thoughts become certain and form into solid beliefs. You are very directed; you concentrate on what is in front of you: your computer screen, the other person&#x2019;s voice, the hammer in your hand. This is the state of attention best suited for:<br><br>�Concentrating on accomplishing tasks.<br><br>�Decision-making.<br><br>�Attending to details and timelines.<br><br>2. Sorting Attention<br><br>This describes the subconscious state of mind, where your brain produces more alpha waves. Your thoughts wander back and forth, sorting through information, comparing one thing to another. In this state of attention you are:<br><br>�Trying to understand.<br><br>�Digesting information or experiences.<br><br>�Thinking through confusion.<br><br>�Weighing multiple choices.<br><br>3. Open Attention<br><br>This is an unconscious state of mind, where your brain is producing more theta waves. Your thoughts are very wide and internal, as in a daydream. In this state of mind you are:<br><br>�Imagining possibilities, new ways to approach old problems.<br><br>�Exploring different options by seeing things in a new way.<br><br>�Associating to past experiences, stories, and people: &#x201c;Oh, that reminds me of this.&#x201d;<br><br>Our minds are constantly shifting quickly between these three states of attention&#x2014;from focused to sorting to open, and from open to sorting to focused, often without our awareness. You might have experienced this when, driving on the interstate at night, you passed by exit 15 and then suddenly found yourself at exit 18. You were unaware of passing exits 16 and 17. Your attention shifted from the cars around you, to a song on the radio, to your own internal thoughts. What happened, in fact, is that your &#x201c;thought&#x201d; was changing form, shifting from focused to sorting to open attention. Your mind became like a loom, weaving different ideas in a new way, or making associative leaps between past and present. We call this way of thinking &#x201c;relational logic,&#x201d; because your mind is creating new connections between thoughts.<br><br>We shift between these three states all the time. Each one is a stage of &#x201c;mental metabolism,&#x201d; where your mind is taking in information, organizing it, digesting it, evaluating it, eliminating it, arranging it into new patterns and ideas, storing it, and then sorting it again to decide how to express it.<br><br>Why Don&#x2019;t We Value All Three States of Attention?<br><br>When somebody does not respond to us verbally, when he stares out the window, jiggles, or paces, we often assume he is not &#x201c;paying attention.&#x201d; This is not necessarily true. These may be indicators of different states of thinking and different ways of paying attention. Exploring, wondering, imagining, reflecting, sorting, are all different stages of effective thinking. They are all natural aspects of paying attention&#x2014;each useful for different things.<br><br>However, most of us have been taught to consider only a focused state of attention as being valuable, and we assume that sorting and open attention are a waste of time.<br><br>We refer to these states negatively as being confused, being distracted, or spacing out. When most of us sense our thoughts wandering, we jolt ourselves awake, grasping for the old habit of finding a quick answer or the next action step. We have been taught to analyze our way out of any problem as quickly as possible. Thus, when our minds are confused and sorting information, we panic and reflexively attempt to use logic to &#x201c;get to the point,&#x201d; to focus.<br><br>In Western cultures, when someone looks pensive or lost in thought, we think of it as a perfect opportunity to interrupt them. When someone is working through confusion, we jump in to help, as if confusion is something to be quickly cured. We are habituated to giving answers, taking swift action, and deciding something now. However, unless we are willing to spend time not knowing, with our minds wide open in wonder, we won&#x2019;t generate the kind of innovative thinking we so desperately need.<br><br>In the recent past, numerous cognitive neuroscientists have conducted studies that reveal that, like the tip of an iceberg, only a very small percentage of our cognitive activities (decisions, emotions, actions, behavior) involve conscious attention. The vast majority of remaining mental activity is beneath the surface of our awareness, where our minds explore relationships and make unconscious connections. You may not think of this as &#x201c;work,&#x201d; but your mind is in fact working in this state of open, relational thinking. <br><br>It may be, in fact, that the challenges you face have a greater chance of being resolved when you are in an open state of attention without interference. This is where ingenuity can arise, grand symphonies and great inventions can be imagined, ruptured relationships can be repaired, and solutions to sweeping systemic issues, such as climate change, can emerge.</p><h2>A Handbook to Biblical Hebrew: An Introductory Grammar</h2><p>Written to facilitate study in Kelley&#39;s widely-used Biblical Hebrew: An Introductory Grammar, this handbook provides a complete answer key to the exercises in the grammar as well as practical helps, footnotes, word lists, test suggestions, and other supplementary material--all written to free up valuable class time and to aid individuals studying Hebrew on their own.</p><p>Written to facilitate study in Page Kelley&#39;s widely used &#39;BIBLICAL HEBREW: AN INTRODUCTORY GRAMMAR, &#39; this new handbook provides a simple yet effective format that enables students to quickly resolve their study problems.

In this enchanting illustrated volume, the fantastical world of Neverland and its magical inhabitants, including the Lost Boys, Captain Hook, Tiger Lily, and the beloved Tinker Bell, are brought to life like never before.</p><p><em>Peter Pan</em>&nbsp;is packed with a lush array of colorful illustrations and interactive removable features, including a detailed map of Neverland, a croc o&#x2019;clock with hands you can rotate to tell time, Peter&#x2019;s shadow, and more. Beautiful and captivating, filled with breathtaking artwork, this stunning book is sure to become a treasured keepsake for fans of all ages.</p></p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Brandeis: American Prophet (Jewish Lives)</h2><p><b>From the prizewinning Jewish Lives series, a&nbsp;riveting new examination of the leading progressive justice of his era, published in the centennial year of his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court</b><br><br> According to Jeffrey Rosen, Louis D. Brandeis was &#x201c;the Jewish Jefferson,&#x201d; the greatest critic of what he called &#x201c;the curse of bigness,&#x201d; in business and government, since the author of the Declaration of Independence. Published to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of his Supreme Court confirmation on June 1, 1916, <i>Louis D. Brandeis: American Prophet</i> argues that Brandeis was the most farseeing constitutional philosopher of the twentieth century. In addition to writing the most famous article on the right to privacy, he also wrote the most important Supreme Court opinions about free speech, freedom from government surveillance, and freedom of thought and opinion. And as the leader of the American Zionist movement, he convinced Woodrow Wilson and the British government to recognize a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

The social sweep and descriptive power of&nbsp;Lewis&#x2019;s&nbsp;fiction earned him international recognition as a chronicler of his times, and in 1930 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first American thus honored.<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Arrowsmith</i>&nbsp;(1925), Lewis portrays the medical education and career of Martin Arrowsmith, a physician who finds his commitment to the ideals of his profession tested by the greed and opportunism he encounters in private practice, public health work, and scientific research. The novel reaches its climax as its hero faces his greatest medical and moral challenges amid a deadly outbreak of plague on a Caribbean island.&nbsp;<i>Arrowsmith</i>&nbsp;was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, which Lewis refused to accept.<br><i><br> <i>Elmer Gantry</i></i>&nbsp;(1927) aroused intense controversy with its brutal depiction of a hypocritical preacher in relentless pursuit of worldly pleasure and power. Through his satiric examination of evangelical religion, Lewis captures the growing cultural and political tension during the 1920s between the forces of secularism and fundamentalism. Gantry, with his glib eloquence and behind-the-scenes self-indulgence, has become an archetypal figure in American culture.<br><i><br> <i>Dodsworth&nbsp;</i></i>(1929) follows Sam Dodsworth, a wealthy retired Midwestern automobile manufacturer, as he travels through England, France, Germany, and Italy with his increasingly restless wife, Fran. The novel intimately explores the unraveling of their marriage while pitting the proud heritage of European high culture against the rude strength of ascendant American commercialism.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

His college career was interrupted by various part-time occupations, including a period working at the Helicon Home Colony, Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s socialist experiment in New Jersey. He worked for some years as a free lance editor and journalist, during which time he published several minor novels. But with the publication of <b>Main Street </b>(1920), which sold half a million copies, he achieved wide recognition. This was followed by the two novels considered by many to be his finest, <b>Babbitt </b>(1922) and <b>Arrowsmith </b>(1925), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1926, but declined by Lewis. In 1930, following <b>Elmer Gantry </b>(1927) and <b>Dodsworth </b>(1929), Sinclair Lewis became the first American author to be awarded the Nobel Prize for distinction in world literature. This was the apogee of his literary career, and in the period from <b>Ann Vickers </b>(1933) to the posthumously published <b>World So Wide </b>(1951) Lewis wrote ten novels that reveal the progressive decline of his creative powers. <b>From Main Street to Stockholm</b>, a collection of his letters, was published in 1952, and <b>The Man from Main Street</b>, a collection of essays, in 1953. During his last years Sinclair Lewis wandered extensively in Europe, and after his death in Rome in 1951 his ashes were returned to his birthplace.Published from 1925 through 1929, these represent some of Lewis's most noted works. His novels can be deceiving, as the simplicity of the style belies the seriousness of his subject. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>C++ Programming: From Problem Analysis to Program Design (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Learn how to program with C++ using today&#39;s definitive choice for your first programming language experience -- C++ PROGRAMMING: FROM PROBLEM ANALYSIS TO PROGRAM DESIGN, 8E.

Ostensibly written by an English knight, the Travels purport to relate his experiences in the Holy Land, Egypt, India, and China. Mandeville claims to have served in the Great Khan&#x2019;s army and to have journeyed to ";the lands beyond"; countries populated by dog-headed men, cannibals, Amazons, and pygmies. This translation by the esteemed C.W.R.D. Moseley conveys the elegant style of the original, making this an intriguing blend of fact and absurdity, and offering wondrous insight into fourteenth-century conceptions of the world. Includes a revised introduction, appendices, an index of place names, new notes, and updated suggestions for further reading</p><p>By the standards of the 14th century, the writing style of the man who called himself Sir John Mandeville is so informal as to be nearly chummy: &#34;He who wants to pass over the sea to Jerusalem, may go by many ways, both by sea and by land depending on the countries he comes from; many ways come to a single end. But do not think I shall tell of all the towns and cities and castles that men shall go by, for then I must make too long a tale of it.&#34; Historians remain skeptical as to whether the author really did journey to the Holy Land and Egypt, or hire himself out as a soldier to the Great Khan of China. Whatever the case, it is indisputable that he is one of the first modern travel writers, as we have come to know the genre, and that his book was considered authoritative in matters geographical throughout Europe--consulted by Leonardo da Vinci and Christopher Columbus alike.<b>Sir John Mandeville</b> left his native St Albans in 1322 and died in Liege in 1372.</p><h2>Public Finance (The McGraw-Hill Series in Economics)</h2><p><i>Public Finance</i> benefits from the combined efforts of Harvey Rosen&#x2019;s market-leading book and co-author Ted Gayer&#x2019;s research and government agency experience. This combination of experience is able to explain as clearly as possible how the tools of economics can be used to analyze government expenditure and tax policies. This new edition incorporates recent developments and along the way takes students to the frontiers of current research and policy. While the information presented is cutting edge and reflects the work of economists currently active in the field, the approach makes the text accessible to undergraduates whose only prior exposure to economics is at the introductory level. <p> All of the changes in the Tenth edition were made to further the authors&#x2019; goal of providing students with a clear and coherent view of the role of government spending and taxation. The authors&#x2019; years of policy experience have convinced themselves that modern public finance provides a practical and invaluable framework for thinking about policy issues. The goal is simple: to emphasize the links between sound economics and the analysis of real-world policy problems.</p><p> Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, and how they need it, so that your class time is more engaging and effective.</p></p><p>Ted Gayer&nbsp;is vice president&nbsp;is director dell' Economic Studies Program&nbsp;is Joseph A.

Whether or not the reader believes in the Bible or not, he or she can be fully confident that my book conveys substantive information about the workability of Noah&#39;s Ark and its inhabitants.</p><p>Correcting the Critics <p>The critics' remarks (such as the Bible writers being "goatherders", and the Flood account being "a campfire story") not only display their prejudices, but also speak volumes about their abysmal ignorance about this whole subject. </p><p>The rapid origin of new species (in thousands of years or less) is not speculation but demonstrated fact, and is not at all a concession to evolution. The notion about me having Noah standing behind buckets while horses urinate, or post-Flood animals needing to dig out corpses, are nothing more than ridiculous misrepresentations of what I actually wrote. These are also nothing more than false rumors about my book that have been going around for some time, and their appearance in the negative reviews also makes it doubtful if the critics have even bothered to read my book. It is not I, but the critics, who are indulging in fantasy. </p><p>Statements about the Ark account violating Occam's razor sound very intellectual, but are widely off the mark. In fact, throughout my work, I have scrupulously avoided speculative scenarios, ad hoc processes, and weakly-supported conjectures. All of the solutions to the putative problems with the Ark account in this book are based on a solid study of low-tech animal-keeping techniques, low-tech husbandry, etc. Moreover, far from being fantastic, speculative, or even theoretical, the techniques and solutions that I cite in this book have been APPLIED by various uneducated, pre-industrial peoples throughout history. Much of the contents of my book discusses and documents this central fact. Finally, I demonstrate in my book that there are often SEVERAL low-tech solutions to putative problems with the Ark, and only one of these solutions will do. </p><p>It is obvious that the critics have not even remotely come to grips with the data presented in this book.</p>John Woodmorappe has an MA in Geology, a BA in Geology, and a BA in Biology.

When he died in 1899,&nbsp;even his religious enemies acknowledged that he might have aspired to the U.S. presidency had he been willing to mask his opposition to religion. To the question that retains its controversial power today&#x2014;was the United States founded as a Christian nation?&#x2014;Ingersoll answered an emphatic no.</p><p>In this provocative biography, Susan Jacoby, the author of <i>Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism</i>, restores Ingersoll to his rightful place in an American intellectual tradition extending from Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine to the current generation of&nbsp; &#x201c;new atheists.&#x201d; Jacoby illuminates the ways in which America&#x2019;s often-denigrated and forgotten secular history encompasses issues, ranging from women&#x2019;s rights to evolution, as potent and divisive today as they were in Ingersoll&#x2019;s time. Ingersoll emerges in this portrait&nbsp;as one of the indispensable public figures who keep an alternative version of history alive. He devoted his life to that greatest secular idea of all&#x2014;liberty of conscience belonging&nbsp; to the religious and nonreligious alike.</p></p><p><b>Susan Jacoby</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism</i><i>,</i><i>The Age of American Unreason</i><i>, </i><i>Alger Hiss and the Battle for History,</i> and <i>The Last Men on Top,</i> a recently published eBook. She lives in New York City.&#x201c;A must-read book.&#x201d;<b>&nbsp;</b>&#x2014;Bill Moyers, from &#x201c;Moyers &amp; Co&#x201d; interview (Bill Moyers <i>Moyers &amp; Co.</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Jacoby succeeds in capturing Ingersoll's remarkable appeal across sectarian and political boundaries. His warmth, humor, tolerance, and rhetorical skill are vividly conveyed, and they are validated by much contemporaneous testimony from figures who would ordinarily have been expected to shun an infamous blasphemer.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frederick Crews, University of California, Berkeley (Frederick Crews)<br><br>&#x201c;As someone who did brave battle with narrow-minded fundamentalists in his own day, Robert Ingersoll would surely be appalled at the political influence of their heirs today. But their very rise makes Susan Jacoby&#x2019;s fine, compact and judicious account of Ingersoll&#x2019;s life and ideas all the more important. She has given us a splendid intellectual portrait of an American who deserves to be far better known.&#x201d;&#x2014;Adam Hochschild, author of <i>Bury the Chains&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>To End All Wars</i> (Adam Hochschild)<br><br>"Robert Ingersoll used his wit to blast the absurdities of religion, while his warmth kept him close to his audiences. He has found his perfect biographer in Susan Jacoby, who uses his story to provide deep insights not only into Ingersoll&#x2019;s century but our own."&#x2014;Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of <i>36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</i><br> (Rebecca Newberger Goldstein)<br><br>&#x201c;Susan Jacoby has written a necessary, informative, and intelligent survey of the life, times, and writings of a most neglected figure in American history.&nbsp;A serious and thoughtful reflection on a topic of interest to historians, humanists, and social scientists, let alone general readers, <i>The Great Agnostic</i> will deepen one of the most important of contemporary debates.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alan Wolfe, author of <i>The Future of Liberalism</i> (Alan Wolfe)<br><br>&#x201c;Jacoby&#x2019;s goal of elucidating the life and work of Robert Ingersoll is admirably accomplished. She offers a host of well-chosen quotations from his work, and she deftly displays the effect he had on others.&nbsp;For instance: after a young Eugene V. Debs heard Ingersoll talk, Debs accompanied him to the train station and then &#x2014; just so he could continue the conversation &#x2014; bought himself a ticket and rode all the way from Terre Haute to Cincinnati. Readers today may well find Ingersoll&#x2019;s company equally entrancing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jennifer Michael Hecht,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Jennifer Michael Hecht <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Jacoby writes with wit and vigor, affectionately resurrecting a man whose life and work are due for reconsideration.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kate Tuttle,&nbsp;<i>The Boston Globe</i> (Kate Tuttle <i>The Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In this persuasive biography, Jacoby makes the case that Americans are dearly indebted to Ingersoll, and would be well-served to revisit his life and writings at a time when religious thought continues to be a divisive force in American civic life. . . . In this important volume, Jacoby illuminates a mind worth celebrating and the story of a life well lived.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mythili Rao, <i>The Daily Beast</i> (Mythili Rao <i>The Daily Beast</i>)<br><br>Won&nbsp; Honorable Mention for the 2013 Southern California Book Festival, in the Biography/Autobiography category, sponored by JM Northern Media LLC.

Lee and Civil War History (Civil War America)</h2><p>Of all the heroes produced by the Civil War, Robert E. Lee is the most revered and perhaps the most misunderstood. Lee is widely portrayed as an ardent antisecessionist who left the United States Army only because he would not draw his sword against his native Virginia, a Southern aristocrat who opposed slavery, and a brilliant military leader whose exploits sustained the Confederate cause. <br><br>Alan Nolan explodes these and other assumptions about Lee and the war through a rigorous reexamination of familiar and long-available historical sources, including Lee's personal and official correspondence and the large body of writings about Lee. Looking at this evidence in a critical way, Nolan concludes that there is little truth to the dogmas traditionally set forth about Lee and the war.<br><br></p><p>"This book will change our perception of the South's premier icon. With a deft pen and a sure grasp of the essential questions, Alan Nolan separates the Lee of reality from the Lee of mythology.

Max, the firstborn, is fiercely intelligent and conniving, determined to succeed financially by any means necessary. Slower-witted Jacob is strong, handsome, and charming but without great purpose in life. While Max is driven by ambition and greed to be more successful than his brother, Jacob is drawn to easy living and decadence. As waves of industrialism and capitalism flood the city, the brothers and their families are torn apart by the clashing impulses of old piety and new skepticism, traditional ways and burgeoning appetites, and the hatred that grows between faiths, citizens, and classes. Despite all attempts to control their destinies, the brothers are caught up by forces of history, love, and fate, which shape and, ultimately, break them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First published in 1936, <i>The Brothers Ashkenazi </i>quickly became a best seller as a sprawling family saga. Breaking away from the introspective <i>shtetl </i>tales of classic nineteenth-century writers, I. J. Singer brought to Yiddish literature the multilayered plots, large casts of characters, and narrative sweep of the traditional European novel. Walking alongside such masters as Zola, Flaubert, and Tolstoy, I . J. Singer&#x2019;s premodernist social novel stands as a masterpiece of storytelling.</p><p><b>Israel Joshua Singer</b>, the older brother of Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning Isaac Bashevis Singer, was born in 1893 in Bilgoraj, Poland, the second of four children of a rabbi. In 1916 he contributed to Yiddish newspapers in Warsaw and then in Kiev, and in the latter city his short story, &#x201c;Pearls,&#x201d; was published, which brought him immediate recognition. In 1921 I. J. Singer was hired as a correspondent for the <i>Jewish Daily Forward. </i>In 1927 he wrote his first novel, <i>Steel and Iron, </i>which was followed five years later by <i>Yoshe Kalb. </i>I. J. Singer came to the United States in 1934, and within two years <i>The Brothers Ashkenazi </i>was published, a work that was not only an instant success but was also destined to become a classic in its time. He died in New York on February 10, 1944.The children loved the yard, no one more so than Jacob Bunem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Sima Meir,&#x201d; he would cry in a loud voice that expressed his lust for life, &#x201c;come play tag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Simha Meir would say brusquely and turn away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twins didn&#x2019;t get along.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Bunem would have preferred it otherwise. He was bigger, stronger, full of laughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jacob Bunem, why do you always laugh?&#x201d; others asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cause I feel like it,&#x201d; he would say, and laugh again so that the others felt compelled to join in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his whole heart and soul into the childish games. No one could run faster, or find better hiding places in the foundation when they played hide and seek, or catch the ends of the cord the roper dragged through the courtyard. He could excavate the biggest rocks and raise them overhead. He never grew tired of the games. Not only did he enjoy playing, but he wanted everyone, especially his brother, to do the same. But Simha Meir would have none of it.</p><h2>Responding to Domestic Violence: The Integration of Criminal Justice and Human Services</h2><p><p>This new edition of the bestselling <strong>Responding to Domestic Violence</strong> explores the response to domestic violence today, not only by the criminal justice system, but also by public and non-profit social service and health care agencies. After providing a brief theoretical overview of the causes of domestic violence and its prevalence in our society, the authors cover such key topics as barriers to intervention, variations in arrest practices, the role of state and federal legislation, and case prosecution. Focusing on both victims and offenders, the book includes unique chapters on models for judicial intervention, domestic violence and health, and children and domestic violence. In addition, this edition provides an in-depth discussion of the concept of coercive control in domestic violence and its importance in understanding victim needs. Finally, this volume includes international perspectives in order to broaden the reader&#x2032;s understanding of alternative responses to the problem of domestic violence.</p></p><p><b>Eve S.

Most textbooks do not include models and decision support systems robust enough for industry. Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts, Strategies, and Cases, 2/e by Simchi-Levy, Kaminsky and Simchi-Levi discusses the problems, models and concepts derived from issues related to effective supply chain management. This text is suitable for both academic study and practicing professionals. While many core supply chain management issues are interrelated, the authors have tried to make each chapter as self-contained as possible so that the reader can refer directly to chapters covering topics of interest. Each chapter utilizes case studies and numerous examples. Mathematical and technical sections can be skipped without loss of continuity. The accompanying CD-ROM also provides two simulations, the Computerized Beer Game and the Risk Pool Game and a computerized tool, new to this edition, for developing and executing supply chain contracts. These packages help illustrate many of the concepts discussed.</p><p>Many companies are involved in the analysis of their supply chains.

And twelve-year-old Sarny is willing to take the risk to learn.<br>Set in the 1850s, Gary Paulsen's groundbreaking new novel is unlike anything else the award-winning author has written. It is a meticulously researched, historically accurate, and artistically crafted portrayal of a grim time in our nation's past, brought to light through the personal history of two unforgettable characters.</p><p>Imagine being beaten for learning to read, shackled and whipped for learning a few letters of the alphabet. Now, imagine a man brave enough to risk torture in order to teach others how to read; his name is Nightjohn, and he sneaks into the slave camps at night to teach other slaves how to read and write. Celebrated author Gary Paulsen writes a searing meditation on why the ability to read and write is radical, empowering , and so necessary to our freedom. These skills threaten our oppressors because they allow us to communicate--to learn the real status of our slavery and to seek liberation.

The ancient Greeks scorned it as ugly and barbaric, but most Americans and Europeans now cite it as their favorite color. In this fascinating history, the renowned medievalist Michel Pastoureau traces the changing meanings of blue from its rare appearance in prehistoric art to its international ubiquity today. </p><p>Any history of color is, above all, a social history. Pastoureau investigates how the ever-changing role of blue in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained glass, heraldry, clothing, paintings, and popular culture. Beginning with the almost total absence of blue from ancient Western art and language, the story moves to medieval Europe. As people began to associate blue with the Virgin Mary, the color became a powerful element in church decoration and symbolism. Blue gained new favor as a royal color in the twelfth century and became a formidable political and military force during the French Revolution. As blue triumphed in the modern era, new shades were created and blue became the color of romance and the blues. Finally, Pastoureau follows blue into contemporary times, when military clothing gave way to the everyday uniform of blue jeans and blue became the universal and unifying color of the Earth as seen from space.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated, <i>Blue</i> tells the intriguing story of our favorite color and the cultures that have hated it, loved it, and made it essential to some of our greatest works of art.</p></p><p><p>"Michel Pastoureau paints a massive canvas in which the history of one color becomes the history of culture itself. This is a study not of color as mere matter but as idea--presenting thousands of years of thinking in blue."<b>--Michael Camille, author of <i>The Medieval Art of Love and Glorious Visions</i></b></p><p>"Michel Pastoureau brilliantly uses the shifting meanings of blue to challenge a whole spectrum of assumptions about color and its symbolic value. . . . Thanks to this study, which is certain to become a classic, blue will never look the same again."<b>--Jori Finkel and Jonathon S. Keats</b></p><b>Michel Pastoureau</b> is a historian and emeritus director of studies at the �cole Pratique des Hautes �tudes de la Sorbonne in Paris.

Visit www.bobgeorge.net.</p>Bob George, seasoned counselor and radio host of &#34;People to People,&#34; wrote this book for anyone who feels disappointed and empty, anyone who lacks peace, contentment, and joy in his or her Christian walk. With a precise delivery, he portrays his own Christian journey--from his first fresh love for Jesus to a faith that eroded into empty disappointment over time and then came out on the other side. He uses personal illustrations in tones of genuine emotion to reveal that knowing Christ personally is far different from simply knowing about Christ. Those who only know about Christ are in what he calls a &#34;half-gospel&#34; relationship instead of a &#34;full-gospel&#34; spiritual relationship. He delivers his thought-provoking message in a spirited manner that emphasizes how to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.

Humboldt&#x2019;s 1799&#x2013;1804 research expedition to Central and South America with botanist Aim� Bonpland not only set the course for the great scientific surveys of the nineteenth century, but also served as the raw material for his many volumes&#x2014;works of both scientific rigor and aesthetic beauty that inspired such essayists and artists as Emerson, Goethe, Thoreau, Poe, and Frederic Edwin Church.<br> <br> <i>Views of Nature</i>, or <i>Ansichten der Natur</i>, was Humboldt&#x2019;s best-known and most influential work&#x2014;and his personal favorite. While the essays that comprise it are themselves remarkable as innovative, early pieces of nature writing&#x2014;they were cited by Thoreau as a model for his own work&#x2014;the book&#x2019;s extensive endnotes incorporate some of Humboldt&#x2019;s most beautiful prose and mature thinking on vegetation structure, its origins in climate patterns, and its implications for the arts. Written for both a literary and a scientific audience, <i>Views of Nature</i> was translated into English (twice), Spanish, and French in the nineteenth century, and it was read widely in Europe and the Americas. But in contrast to many of Humboldt&#x2019;s more technical works, <i>Views of Nature</i> has been unavailable in English for more than one hundred years. Largely neglected in the United States during the twentieth century, Humboldt&#x2019;s contributions to the humanities and the sciences are now undergoing a revival to which this new translation will be a critical contribution.</p></p><p><b>Stephen T.

Riutta <i>Well-read Naturalist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is easy to overlook the work of the translator in reviewing a translation&#x2014;a fate keenly felt by some of the learned women who slogged away at turning Humboldt&#x2019;s French and German prose into English in the nineteenth century. Person is to be warmly congratulated on a highly readable translation that loses nothing of the complexity of the original. I consider his &#x201c;Translator&#x2019;s Note&#x201d; a fundamental part of the translation itself, not only because it reminds us of his essential mediating role in the production of a truly modern rendering of Humboldt&#x2019;s work. The issues that he addresses&#x2014;sensibility to Humboldt&#x2019;s style and sentence structure, idiosyncrasies and outdated terms in the original&#x2014;confront us in a very immediate way with the business of transforming one series of ideas and images into a different language, culture, and, in this case, time. As scholars working in Humboldt studies gear up for commemorations in honor of the 250th anniversary of Humboldt&#x2019;s birth in 2019, this new edition of the <i>Ansichten der Natur</i> will prove an invaluable basis for further discussion and research.&#x201d; (<i>Isis</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Long awaited by Humboldtians, this illuminating new edition of <i>Views of Nature</i>&#x2014;offering not just vivid natural scenes (&#x2018;views&#x2019; in the most obvious sense) but also von Humboldt&#x2019;s still-fresh views on the<i> significance</i> of nature and its study&#x2014;is a gift that transcends disciplines and even history.&nbsp;A book that was deeply relevant and constructively challenging in the age of empire has become even more necessary in the age of climate change.

Boyd, Ball State University"<br><br>I was looking for a relatively small-sized text, so that other readings could be assigned; one that is not organized by 'band, tribe, chiefdom, state' and 'hunters and gatherers, horticulturalists, etc.' but that does contain basic information about the differences these types of cultures bring with them; and a text that deals with methods and explores what it means to be an anthropologist.

Written by one of contemporary philosophy&#39;s top teachers and revised by a best selling author, this textbook even-handedly raises important ethical questions and challenges students to develop their own moral theories by applying them. This revision also presents an even broader presentation of various positions, featuring more feminist and multicultural perspectives as well. ETHICS: DISCOVERING RIGHT AND WRONG, 8E begins with easy to read chapters that introduce questions of meta-ethics and major moral theories. Later chapters address special topics in personal and religious ethics as well as the most recent developments in moral theory, including a new chapter on Biology and Ethics. Study questions for each chapter, along with useful bibliographies, make grasping the material more accessible than ever.</p><p>Louis P.

He tells the stories of the rabbis, mystics, and messiahs of the medieval and early modern periods and guides us through the many varieties of Judaism today. Goodman's compelling narrative spans the globe, from the Middle East, Europe, and America to North Africa, China, and India. He explains the institutions and ideas on which all forms of Judaism are based, and masterfully weaves together the different threads of doctrinal and philosophical debate that run throughout its history.</p><p><i>A History of Judaism</i> is a spellbinding chronicle of a vibrant and multifaceted religious tradition that has shaped the spiritual heritage of humankind like no other.</p></p><p><p> "In this remarkable book, Martin Goodman compresses the entire history of Judaism--from Josephus to Jewish Renewal--into a thoroughly readable synthesis, paying special attention to Jewish diversity and drawing on up-to-date scholarship. Henceforward, all students of Judaism should begin here."<b>--Jonathan D. Sarna, author of <i>When General Grant Expelled the Jews</i></b></p><p> "Martin Goodman's <i>A History of Judaism</i> is a boundlessly edifying work, combining a glittering career's worth of erudition with the drive for clarity and the expressive gesture of a master educator. Everyone will find a great deal to learn from--and think about--here."<b>--Jeremy Dauber, author of <i>Jewish Comedy: A Serious History</i></b></p><p> "Covering an astonishingly wide geographic spread, Martin Goodman's authoritative and nuanced history places Jewish communities in their many contexts and analyzes their religious and intellectual developments from antiquity to modern times. This thoughtful book allows the reader to follow the thread of Judaism in its multiple manifestations through the ages."<b>--Sarah Stroumsa, professor of Jewish thought and Arabic studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</b></p><p> "Martin Goodman writes with the intimacy of an insider and the breadth of an incisive scholar. At once lucid and authoritative, expansive and nuanced, his book is the finest introduction to Judaism written in recent years."<b>--Steven J. Zipperstein, author of <i>Pogrom: Kishinev and the Tilt of History</i></b></p><p> "With admirable erudition, Martin Goodman offers an entirely fresh perspective on how Judaism combines both past and present. This book will surely become the standard work on this vast subject."<b>--David Biale, University of California, Davis</b></p><p> "A magisterial journey along the highways and many of the byways of Jewish thought. Firmly anchored in his area of expertise, the renowned historian of late antiquity Martin Goodman ventures beyond, from ancient times to modern, in a compelling display of scholarly virtuosity. <i>A History of Judaism</i> is a major achievement."<b>--David Myers, professor of Jewish history, UCLA, and president of the Center for Jewish History</b></p><p>"Multiple millennia. Numberless generations of seers, scribes, and scholars. Martin Goodman&#x2019;s lambent prose captures it all, the whole glorious, noisy, improbable history of so many different Jews and so many different inflections of Jewishness. Savor the journey."<b>--Paula Fredriksen, author of <i>Augustine and the Jews</i></b></p><p> "This insightful book is the work of a major historian of Judaism. Goodman's bold and original thinking, excellent historical judgment, and elegant style are all on display here. <i>A History of Judaism</i> is an introduction for the twenty-first century, incorporating new knowledge for our own times."<b>--Philip Alexander, author of <i>The Mystical Texts</i></b></p><b>Martin Goodman</b> is professor of Jewish studies at the University of Oxford, where he is president of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies and a fellow of Wolfson College.

The culture of confession has given rise to novels that begin with an unspeakable act (graphically described) and end in redemption (this part is usually more vague). That's not how it works in J.L. Carr's quiet, brief, dreamy <i>A Month in the Country</i>. Writing in 1978, Carr's narrator, Tom Birkin, recalls the summer of 1920. A veteran of the Great War and a cuckold, Tom arrives in Oxgodby to restore a medieval mural in the church. His single season in this town in the north of England passes quickly: he sleeps in the belfry, makes a friend or two, falls secretly in love with the vicar's wife, and, chipping away at plaster and dirt, uncovers a lost masterpiece. These events seem to melt past Tom in the heat of the perfect, fleeting English summer: "The front gardens of cottages were crammed with marjoram and roses, marguerites, sweet William, at night heavy with the scent of stocks. The Vale was heavy with leaves, motionless in the early morning, black caves of shadow in the midday heat, blurring the sound of trains hammering north and south." <p> Carr devotes many fewer words to Tom's time in the war. The vicar's wife tries to ask him about it. "'What about hell on earth?' she said. I told her I'd seen it and lived there and that, mercifully, they usually left an exit open." His healing consists of not talking about his past--perhaps a revolutionary notion these days. <i>A Month in the Country</i>, with its paean to a lost, good place, oddly recalls Alain-Fournier's <i>Le Grand Meaulnes</i>. But where that novel was elliptical, Carr's work values clarity and simplicity above all. These are rare enough qualities, but to find them in a novel of romance and healing is a rarer pleasure still. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>James Lloyd Carr was born in 1912 and attended the village school at Carlton Miniott in Yorkshire.

Sixty strategies is a lot of ground to cover, but in reviewing them all again (I've done it several times already!), I was reminded of the beauty of these amazing trading instruments.</p> <p>Options give us the ability to do so many things&#x2014;they enable us to configure our investment aims in any way we like. The benefits of options are often trotted out to new students or prospective customers as the first salvo of an up-sell campaign, but they're worth looking at again, this time from a <i>practical</i> point of view. </p> <p>Options enable us to: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Control more assets for less money.</b> </p> <p>One option contract represents 100 shares of stock and is usually a fraction of the cost of what you'd pay for the equivalent number of shares. </p> <p>For example, ABCD stock is priced at $26.20 on June 2, 2004. </p> <p>An option to <i>buy</i> ABCD shares (a call option) might be priced at $2.60. Because one contract represents 100 shares, we can therefore buy one ABCD call contract for $260.00 100 * 2.60. The alternative would be to buy 100 shares of the stock for a total sum of $2,620. So, in this example, we can buy ABCD calls options for around 10% of the stock price in order to control $2,620 of ABCD stock until the appropriate expiration date of the option. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Trade with leverage.</b> </p> <p>Because our cost basis is so low, the position is much more sensitive to the underlying stock's price movements, and hence our percentage returns can be so much greater. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Trade for income.</b> </p> <p>We can design strategies specifically for the purpose of generating income on a regular basis. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Profit from declining stocks.</b> </p> <p>We can use puts and calls to ensure that we can make money if the stock goes up, down, or sideways. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Profit from volatility or protection against various factors.</b> </p> <p>Different options strategies protect us or enable us to benefit from factors such as time decay, volatility, lack of volatility, and more. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Reduce or eliminate risk.</b> </p> <p>Options enable us to substantially reduce our risk of trading, and in certain rare cases, we can even eliminate risk altogether, albeit with the trade-off of very limited profit potential! </p> </li> </ul> <p>So, with all the different benefits of options, why on earth would traders <i>not</i> be curious to learn more about them? Well, for a start, the initial barrier to entry is quite high, in that options are reasonably complex instruments to understand for the first time. After you're over that hurdle, though, they become more and more fascinating! The other reason is that there is such a multitude of other investment securities for people to choose from, many will pick what seems like the simplest, rather than what may fit their investment aims the best. </p> <p>Given that options can be a challenge, it's my job to make life as simple as possible for you. One of the ways in which I do this is to break things down into pictures so we can <i>see</i> what we're doing. As soon as we can see what we're doing, life becomes much clearer when you're creating options strategies. Everything to do with OptionEasy and all my material is designed to be visual-friendly. This goes back to when I started to learn all about options and the fact that the penny only started to drop when I converted the concepts into pictures. All of a sudden, everything fit into place, and I started to be able to extend logic faster and further than before. </p> <p>This book is designed to be a reference book, one that you can pick up any time to learn about and understand a strategy. It isn't an academic workbook. It's a practical book, written for traders, designed to work interactively with your trading activities. As the title suggests, it's a book about options strategies, of which we take on 58! That's not to say you need to learn about each and every one of them, but at least you have the choice! </p> <p>In order to make life easier for you, we categorize the strategies into different descriptions for the following criteria: </p> <p><b>Proficiency Level</b></p> <p>Each strategy is assigned a "value" in term of its suitability for different levels of trader. Each level is given an associated icon. </p> <blockquote> <p>Strategies suitable for novices</p> <p>Strategies suitable for intermediates</p> <p>Strategies suitable for advanced traders</p> <p>Strategies suitable for expert traders</p> </blockquote> <p>The allocations are defined according to a subjective view of complexity, risk, and desirability of the strategy. Therefore, some highly risky and undesirable strategies have been put into the <i>Expert</i> basket in order to warn novices and intermediates away. Also <i>Novice</i> strategies are not exclusive to novice traders. It's simply as question of suitability, and novice strategies are highly relevant and suitable to all levels of trader. </p> <p>In some cases, the strategy is not complex at all but is considered unacceptably risky for novice and intermediate traders (at least without a warning). I have tried to be objective here, but I'm mindful not just of my own experiences but also the many students who regularly show me their trading disasters! Conservative by nature, I'm a believer that <i>loss of opportunity is preferable to loss of capital</i> (Joe DiNapoli), and perhaps some of these rankings bear testimony to this philosophy. </p> <p><b>Market Outlook</b></p> <p>This is where we define whether a strategy is suitable to bullish, bearish, or direction neutral outlooks. </p> <blockquote> <p>Strategies suitable for bullish market conditions </p> <p>Strategies suitable for bearish market conditions </p> <p>Strategies suitable for sideways market conditions </p> </blockquote> <p><b>Volatility</b></p> <p>Volatility is one of the most important factors affecting option pricing and therefore option trading. You really should familiarize yourself with the concept, which, forgive the plug, is dealt with in my first book, <i>Options Made Easy</i>. </p> <p>Here, we define whether a strategy is suitable for trades anticipating high volatility or low volatility in the markets. Some strategies, such as Straddles, require high volatility after you've placed the trade, so a Straddle would fall into the High Volatility category. </p> <blockquote> <p>Strategies suitable for high volatility markets</p> <p>Strategies suitable for low volatility markets</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Risk</b></p> <p>With any trade you're looking to make, you must be aware of your potential risk, reward, and breakeven point(s). </p> <p>Some strategies have unlimited risk; others have limited risk, even if that "limited" risk means 100% of the trade. Believe it or not, sometimes with options it's possible to lose more than 100%. In such cases, or when there is no definable stop to the potential risk of a trade, you're well advised to be aware of such a position in advance! </p> <p>Here, we show you which strategies have capped or uncapped risk. Strategies with uncapped risk aren't necessarily all bad, but you should at least be aware of what you are getting into. Often you can mitigate such risk with a simple stop loss provision, in which case you're not going to liable to uncapped risk. Often, such uncapped risk scenarios only occur if the stock falls to zero or rises to infinity, which mostly are rare circumstances, but you're better off being aware! </p> <blockquote> <p>Strategies with capped risk</p> <p>Strategies with uncapped risk</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Reward</b></p> <p>Following the risk scenarios described previously, the strategies also have potential reward scenarios, too. </p> <p>Just because a strategy has unlimited reward potential doesn't mean that it's necessarily a great strategy, and just because it may have capped reward doesn't mean it's necessarily a bad strategy. </p> <blockquote> <p>Strategies with capped reward</p> <p>Strategies with uncapped reward</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Strategy Type</b></p> <p>Strategies can be used for income purposes (usually short-term) or to make capital gains. Many traders like the Covered Call because it's suitable for novices and because it's an income strategy that they can use every month. </p> <blockquote> <p>Income strategies</p> <p>Capital gain strategies</p> </blockquote> <p><b>Strategy Legs</b></p> <p>Each strategy contains different legs. Some have just one, and others have up to four. Each leg must be composed of any one of the basic four option strategies (long or short call or put) or a long or short stock position. Here's how we identify them: </p> <blockquote> <p>Long stock</p> <p>Short stock</p> <p>Long call</p> <p>Short call</p> <p>Long put</p> <p>Short put</p> </blockquote> <p>All strategies contain real-life examples at the end of each guide. </p> <p><b>Chapter by Chapter</b></p> <p>In terms of structure, I've tried to make this book as easily navigable as possible, and much of that is solved by matrix-style tables of contents. </p> <p>Each chapter contains strategies that are commensurate with a specific style of options trading. Inevitably there's some overlap between chapters for certain strategies, which we address in the appropriate places. </p> <p>Chapter 1 addresses the basic strategies, including buying and selling stocks and then buying and selling calls and puts. After you understand those cornerstones and how the pictures relate to each strategy, then you can fast-forward to any part of the book and any strategy you like. All strategy guides are modular and follow the same format, so that you can become familiar with the style and structure of the content. </p> <p>Chapter 2 is all about income strategies. An income strategy is when you're effectively a net seller of short-term options, which generates (monthly) income. You have to be careful, though, not to expose yourself to unlimited risk scenarios, which is why we use icons to identify excess risk. </p> <p>In Chapter 3, we cover "vertical spreads." A vertical spread is where we buy and sell the same numbers of the same options (calls or puts) but with different strike prices. Obviously, there's some overlap here with other chapters, which is why the chapter is comparatively small. </p> <p>Chapter 4 goes into volatility strategies and is bound to be as popular as the income strategies chapter! Here we address those strategies that benefit from increasing volatility <i>after you've placed the trade</i>. </p> <p>In Chapter 5, we reverse this and explore those strategies that benefit from decreasing volatility <i>after you've placed the trade</i>. So here we're looking for stocks that we think will be rangebound for some time. Typically these are short-term strategies. </p> <p>Chapter 6 identifies the ratio spreads and backspreads, where you're using increasing leverage to increase your returns. These are for advanced and experienced traders only! </p> <p>In Chapter 7, we look at synthetic strategies that mainly mimic other strategic goals, using a combination of stock legs, call legs, and put legs. For example, we can replicate owning a stock purely by buying and selling calls and puts in such a way that we hardly pay any cash out. In other words, we've simulated the risk of owning the stock, but with no cash outlay. We can also synthetically re-create straddle positions and other strategies. </p> <p>Lastly, in Chapter 8, we investigate some of the taxation issues that will confront you during your trading careers. This is not a definitive tax guide but rather more a flag raiser. </p> <p><b>Strategy by Strategy</b></p> <p>Each strategy is presented in a modular format. In this way, the book should be easy to navigate. The modules are numbered, and the numbering system applies throughout each chapter and each strategy: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The first number refers to the chapter itself. So, all headings in Chapter 2 will start with "2." </p> </li> <li> <p>The second number refers to the strategy in question. So, 2.1 refers to the first strategy (Covered Call) in Chapter 2. </p> </li> <li> <p>The third number refers to the module. So, 2.1.1 refers to the "Description" module for the first strategy (Covered Call) in Chapter 2. Because the modules are identical throughout the book, each module number is the same throughout all the strategies. Therefore, module "1," which appears as the third decimal place, is always "Description." The modules are outlined as follows: </p> </li><li> <p>x.y.1 Description</p> <p>Here, we describe the strategy in both words and pictures. We identify the steps for each leg and some general comments about what the overall position will mean to you. </p> </li> <li> <p>x.y.2 Context</p> <p>This section describes the <i>outlook</i> and <i>rationale</i> for the strategy. We also highlight the <i>net position</i> in your account as a result of the trade as well as identify the effect of <i>time decay</i> and the <i>appropriate time period</i> for the strategy. <i>Stock</i> and <i>option-leg selection</i> are important elements of any trade, so these are covered as well. </p> </li><li> <p>x.y.3 Risk Profile</p> <p>This section provides, where possible, simple calculations for you to evaluate the <i>risk, reward,</i> and <i>breakeven</i> points for each strategy. </p> </li><li> <p>x.y.4 Greeks</p> <p>This is where we graphically explain each of the "Greeks." The Greeks are simply sensitivities of options to various factors, such as price movement, time decay, volatility, and interest rates. The Greeks are as follows: </p> <p> <i>Delta:</i> </p> <p>The movement of the option position relative to the movement of the underlying (say, stock) position. The resulting figure gives us an indication of the <i>speed</i> at which the option position is moving relative to the underlying stock position. Therefore, a Delta of 1 means the option position is moving 1 point for every point the stock moves. A Delta of &#x2013;1 means the option position is moving &#x2013;1 point for every point the underlying stock moves. </p> <p>Typically, at-the-money options move with a Delta of 0.5 for calls and &#x2013;0.5 for puts, meaning that ATM options move half a point for every 1 point that the underlying asset moves. This does not mean the option leg is moving slower in percentage terms, just in terms of dollar for dollar. </p> <p>Delta is another way of expressing the probability of an option expiring in-the-money. This makes sense because an ATM call option has a Delta of 0.5; i.e., 50%, meaning a 50% chance of expiring ITM. A deep ITM call will have a Delta of near 1, or 100%, meaning a near 100% chance of expiration ITM. A very out-of-the-money call option will have a Delta of close to zero, meaning a near zero chance of expiring ITM. </p> <p>So, Delta can be interpreted both in terms of the <i>speed</i> of the position and the probability of an option expiring ITM. Some advanced traders like to trade with the sum of their portfolio Delta at zero, otherwise known as Delta-Neutral trading.

Here, Vendler turns her illuminating skills as a critic to 150 selected poems of Emily Dickinson. As she did in <i>The Art of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Sonnets</i>, she serves as an incomparable guide, considering both stylistic and imaginative features of the poems.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>In selecting these poems for commentary Vendler chooses to exhibit many aspects of Dickinson&#x2019;s work as a poet, &#x201c;from her first-person poems to the poems of grand abstraction, from her ecstatic verses to her unparalleled depictions of emotional numbness, from her comic anecdotes to her painful poems of aftermath.&#x201d; Included here are many expected favorites as well as more complex and less often anthologized poems. Taken together, Vendler&#x2019;s selection reveals Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s development as a poet, her astonishing range, and her revelation of what Wordsworth called &#x201c;the history and science of feeling.&#x201d; <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br>In accompanying commentaries Vendler offers a deeper acquaintance with Dickinson the writer, &#x201c;the inventive conceiver and linguistic shaper of her perennial themes.&#x201d;&nbsp;All of Dickinson&#x2019;s preoccupations&#x2014;death, religion, love, the natural world, the nature of thought&#x2014;are explored here in detail, but Vendler always takes care to emphasize the poet&#x2019;s startling imagination and the ingenuity of her linguistic invention. Whether exploring less familiar poems or favorites we thought we knew, Vendler reveals Dickinson as &#x201c;a master&#x201d; of a revolutionary verse-language of immediacy and power. Dickinson: Selected Poems and Commentaries will be an indispensable reference work for students of Dickinson and readers of lyric poetry.<br></p></p><p>Helen Vendler is A.

Her poetry contains, no, is, the most essential, passionate use of English and the most essential, passionate connection between the English language and nature (our nature, birds and bees nature, God's nature)...Dickinson's spare use of words are just the tip of her iceberg; the waters below contain so many secrets that it truly helps to have a guide to the meter, the myth, the thread of dreams.

(Stacy Russo <i>Library Journal</i> 2010-10-15)<br><br>If it's been a while since you last sat down with Dickinson, now is a great time: Helen Vendler's new book, <i>Dickinson: Selected Poems and Commentaries</i>, is both an anthology (it contains 150 of Dickinson's nearly 1,800 poems) and an interpretive introduction, with a short essay following and explaining each poem. Vendler is almost certainly the best poetry critic in America, and she's hit upon a great way of writing about poetry. Reading each poem, followed by Vendler's commentary, it feels like you're in your own private poetry class. (Josh Rothman <i>Boston Globe</i> 2010-10-25)<br><br>[A] superb and invigorating new selection of 150 poems and probing commentaries...The poet that Vendler finds in these poems is an ambitious and sometimes magisterial artist of extraordinary range and verbal control. Vendler's comprehensive reassessment of Dickinson's achievement seems to me the most challenging new reading of Dickinson since the poet Adrienne Rich's remarkable essay "Vesuvius at Home" (1975)...What Vendler, perhaps the most skilled and accomplished close reader of lyric poetry of her generation, adds to this picture is a renewed attention to Dickinson's deliberate and consummate artistry, along with a fresh way to read cryptic poems that may seem, superficially, to have little to do with the "maelstrom" of human emotions. (Christopher Benfey <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2010-11-25)<br><br>The reigning doyenne of American poetry criticism is a close reader par excellence. [Vendler] loves her favorite poets unstintingly. She seems to think and feel in their language--to think and feel through their work, as through a membrane. Her <i>Dickinson: Selected Poems and Commentaries</i> plays exactly to her strengths, as did her 1997 edition of Shakespeare's sonnets...What I like best about Vendler's <i>Dickinson</i> is its can-do attitude. Yes, it assures the reader, the poem says what you think it says: trust your own eyes, experience, and heart...She doesn't try to quash the mystery of the poems; she notes their ambiguities but by and large leaves those to do their work--and leaves us closer to a canonical poet whom we are still only coming to know. (Lorin Stein <i>Harper's</i> 2010-12-01)<br><br><i>Dickinson</i> continues to entertain and enlighten me. Vendler manages to clarify and illuminate Dickinson's poetry without oversimplifying the work of a complex mind.

Garland, Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justice Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor) gives us an engaging and alarming book that aims to vindicate the rights of public school stu�dents, which have so often been undermined by the Supreme Court in recent decades. <br>&nbsp;<br>Judicial decisions assessing the constitutional rights of students in the nation&#x2019;s public schools have consistently generated bitter controversy. From racial segregation to un�authorized immigration, from antiwar protests to compul�sory flag salutes, from economic inequality to teacher-led prayer&#x2014;these are but a few of the cultural anxieties dividing American society that the Supreme Court has addressed in elementary and secondary schools. <i>The Schoolhouse Gate </i>gives a fresh, lucid, and provocative account of the historic legal battles waged over education and illuminates contemporary disputes that continue to fracture the nation. <br>&nbsp;<br>Justin Driver maintains that since the 1970s the Supreme Court has regularly abdicated its responsibility for protecting students&#x2019; constitutional rights and risked trans�forming public schools into Constitution-free zones. Students deriving lessons about citizenship from the Court&#x2019;s decisions in recent decades would conclude that the following actions taken by educators pass constitutional muster: inflicting severe corporal punishment on students without any proce�dural protections, searching students and their possessions without probable cause in bids to uncover violations of school rules, random drug testing of students who are not suspected of wrongdoing, and suppressing student speech for the view�point it espouses. Taking their cue from such decisions, lower courts have upheld a wide array of dubious school actions, including degrading strip searches, repressive dress codes, draconian &#x201c;zero tolerance&#x201d; disciplinary policies, and severe restrictions on off-campus speech. <br>&nbsp;<br>Driver surveys this legal landscape with eloquence, highlights the gripping personal narratives behind landmark clashes, and warns that the repeated failure to honor students&#x2019; rights threatens our basic constitutional order. This magiste�rial book will make it impossible to view American schools&#x2014;or America itself&#x2014;in the same way again. <i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>JUSTIN DRIVER</b> is the Harry N.

It would have been difficult to envision a more stately location for the gathering, as the property called Seven Springs Farm contained one thousand acres of land and a nearly thirty-�thousand-�square-�foot Georgian mansion, boasting some fourteen bedrooms, three swimming pools, two servants&#x2019; quarters, and its own elevator. Despite this grand setting, the pre-�wedding luncheon proved anything but festive. Instead, what began as an engaging discussion rapidly descended into a ferocious dispute, with several members of the wedding party&#x2014;�including both bride and groom&#x2014;�excoriating Justice Felix Frankfurter for an opinion that he issued on behalf of the U.S. Supreme Court only two days earlier. Frankfurter&#x2014;�who prior to joining the Court had been a legendary professor at Harvard Law School, where he was also Philip Graham&#x2019;s beloved mentor&#x2014;�usually relished nothing more than vigorous, even combative intellectual exchange. Indeed, <i>The New York Times</i> would remember Frankfurter as &#x201c;the greatest talker of his time&#x201d; and noted, &#x201c;He loved to argue, his head darting here and there, his hand suddenly gripping the listener&#x2019;s elbow as he made a point.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Mount Kisco, however, the silver-�tongued Frankfurter received more than he could handle. Even close to six decades after the incident, the ugly scene at Seven Springs remained with Katharine Graham, as she recalled in her memoir, <i>Personal History:</i> &#x201c;Felix loved and encouraged loud and violent arguments, which everyone usually enjoyed, but this time the argument went over the edge into bitter passion.&#x201d; Those in attendance reviled Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion as &#x201c;deeply disturb[ing]&#x201d; and &#x201c;shock[ing],&#x201d; she noted. The debate grew so intense, so strained that the groom&#x2019;s best man dissolved into emotion as he emitted not merely discreet sniffles, but full-�fledged waterworks&#x2014;shedding &#x201c;great large tears&#x201d; that he permitted to stream down his crimson cheeks. Frankfurter gamely sought to defend his view, but the onslaught provoked the justice to lose his composure, exclaiming that he would never again discuss judicial business in social settings. Katharine Graham recollected that &#x201c;[t]he argument went on and on,&#x201d; persisting so long, in fact, that they inadvertently kept the Lutheran minister waiting to perform the ceremony for more than an hour. The row did not finally dissipate, she noted, until Frankfurter &#x201c;grabb[ed] [her] arm with his always iron hand and [said], &#x2018;Come along, Kay. We will go for a walk in the woods and calm down.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>What legal decision elicited this acrimony on such an improbable occasion? The underlying dispute dated back five years, to a community located roughly two hundred miles southwest of Seven Springs but whose reality stood much further removed still from the heights of Mount Kisco&#x2019;s rarefied air&#x2014;�in the valleys of Pennsylvania&#x2019;s coal country. On October 22, 1935, in a small town suitably, if unimaginatively, called Minersville, a ten-�year-�old public school student named William Gobitis refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance along with his fifth-�grade classmates. When Gobitis&#x2019;s teacher noticed that he had not joined the others in saluting the American flag, she marched right over and tried to force his arm into the proper position. But Gobitis managed to resist her entreaties, locking his arm into place, with his right hand clutching his pocket. In response, Minersville&#x2019;s notoriously austere school superintendent, Charles Roudabush, contacted state education officials to ensure that he possessed the authority to expel Gobitis for this brazen act of insubordination. It made no difference to Roudabush that Gobitis attributed his unwillingness to recite the pledge to his faith as a Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness. As Gobitis subsequently explained in a letter to the school board, he&#x2014;�and many other Witnesses, including his older sister Lillian&#x2014;�interpreted Exodus&#x2019;s prohibition on worshipping graven images to preclude participation in the ritual. &#x201c;I do not salute the flag not because I do not love my country,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;but [because] I love God more and I must obey His commandments.&#x201d; Despite the claim that the pledge requirement interfered with the Witnesses&#x2019; right to free exercise of religion protected by the Constitution&#x2019;s First Amendment, Roudabush nevertheless expelled the Gobitises, ordering them not to return until they were prepared to salute Old Glory.<br>&nbsp;<br>Although two lower federal courts vindicated the family&#x2019;s claim, Justice Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion for the Court in <i>Minersville School District v. Gobitis</i> maintained that expelling Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses for refusing to recite the pledge did not violate the First Amendment. Portions of Justice Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion, in the 8&#x2013;�1 decision, extolled the unifying potential of requiring students around the nation to honor the American flag. &#x201c;We are dealing with an interest inferior to none in the hierarchy of legal values,&#x201d; Frankfurter proclaimed. &#x201c;National unity is the basis of national security. . . . The flag is the symbol of our national unity, transcending all internal differences, however large, within the framework of the Constitution.&#x201d; Ultimately, however, Frankfurter&#x2019;s reasoning in <i>Gobitis</i> hinged not on the appeal of patriotism but on the overarching principle that it would be improper for the judiciary to reach into public schools, overturning educators&#x2019; independent decisions. &#x201c;The wisdom of training children in patriotic impulses by . . . compulsions which necessarily pervade so much of the educational process is not for our independent judgment,&#x201d; Frankfurter warned in a critical passage. &#x201c;[T]he courtroom is not the arena for debating issues of educational policy. . . . So to hold would in effect make us the school board for the country.&#x201d; The negative consequences of vindicating the Gobitises&#x2019; constitutional challenge in this instance ought not be overlooked, Frankfurter insisted, for invalidating Minersville&#x2019;s expulsions would undermine &#x201c;the authorities in a thousand counties and school districts of this country,&#x201d; amounting to the imposition of &#x201c;pedagogical and psychological dogma in a field where courts possess no marked and certainly no controlling competence.&#x201d; <i>Gobitis</i> concluded, in sum, that judges should mind their own business, and leave educators to the business of molding American minds.<br>&nbsp;<br>In Minersville, news of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s decision stunned the Gobitises. After hearing a radio broadcaster announce the adverse outcome, Lillian and her mother sat speechless in their kitchen for several minutes, paralyzed in disbelief. Their refusal to pledge had long ago transformed the Gobitis children into town pariahs, with peers flinging stones in their direction and sometimes shouting, &#x201c;Here comes Jehovah!&#x201d; The family&#x2019;s successive victories in lower courts caused them to dismiss any concern that the Supreme Court would not also redeem their sacrifices. &#x201c;It never really occurred to us that the Court&#x2019;s decision would be anything but favorable,&#x201d; Lillian recalled. Yet the Court&#x2019;s rejection hardly signaled the end of their ordeal. Shortly after the decision, a close friend called to warn the Gobitises that vigilantes planned to destroy their family-�owned grocery store if they persisted in refusing to salute the flag. Fearing violence, the Gobitis parents hastily arranged for their children to relocate to a safe house, and contacted law enforcement to protect the family&#x2019;s modest business. Although a state police cruiser parked outside the store evidently deterred the plot for physical destruction, Minersville&#x2019;s anti-�Gobitis contingent soon alighted upon an alternate strategy of damaging the business: a boycott. This economic approach gained enough adherents to inflict serious financial distress on the Gobitises, who were forced to borrow money from relatives simply to pay their mortgage.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Gobitises were far from the only members of their faith to suffer in the aftermath of Frankfurter&#x2019;s opinion, as many contemporaneous observers connected a surge of anti-�Witness violence to the Court&#x2019;s legitimation of student salute requirements. The opinion arrived at an especially fraught political moment in American history as patriotic fervor reached a crescendo due to widespread fears that the nation would soon enter World War II. One day before <i>Gobitis</i> appeared, a Gallup poll revealed that 65 percent of Americans anticipated that Germany would attack the United States imminently. American flags sold so briskly during the month of the decision that leading outlets in New York City could not keep the item stocked. Given this frenzied environment, it should hardly be surprising that post-�<i>Gobitis</i> the practice of expelling Jehovah&#x2019;s Witness students for refusing to salute spread dramatically throughout the country. When the Court issued <i>Gobitis,</i> students in fifteen states either had been or were in the process of being expelled due to the saluting controversy. Just three years later, schools had expelled students in every one of the nation&#x2019;s forty-�eight states, totaling approximately two thousand students, virtually all of whom were Witnesses. Some jurisdictions, moreover, followed up on the expulsions by prosecuting Witness parents for contributing to the delinquency of minors, asserting that their children violated compulsory school attendance laws.<br>&nbsp;<br>While <i>Gobitis</i> enjoyed approval in much of the country, the media overwhelmingly reviled the opinion, as more than 170 newspapers condemned the opinion, and only a handful of publications praised it. For present purposes, however, the most remarkable aspect of that reaction was that no single passage in <i>Gobitis</i> drew more ire than Frankfurter&#x2019;s assertion that had the Court invalidated Minersville&#x2019;s salute requirement, it would have succeeded in transforming the Supreme Court into a national school board. This dismissive sentiment especially rankled periodicals concerned with religious autonomy. Thus, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> seized upon Frankfurter&#x2019;s line to suggest that <i>Gobitis</i> &#x201c;has . . . taken a step toward abdicating [the Court&#x2019;s] position as a constitutional guarantor of freedom of worship.&#x201d; Similarly, in an editorial titled &#x201c;The Court Abdicates,&#x201d; <i>The Christian Century</i> insisted that &#x201c;a question of educational policy may also be a question of fundamental rights,&#x201d; and noted that &#x201c;[c]ourts that will not protect even Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses will not long protect anybody.&#x201d; Paul Blakely&#x2014;�writing in the Jesuit magazine <i>America</i>&#x2014;�also contended that <i>Gobitis</i>&#x2019;s avowed withdrawal from the educational domain succeeded in making school boards all-�powerful. &#x201c;What further restrictions upon the right of parents to direct the education of their children will the States impose?,&#x201d; Blakely lamented. &#x201c;We do not know; all we know is that these are hysterical days, and that objectors will find no protection in the Supreme Court.&#x201d;</p><h2>Advancing Your Career: Concepts of Professional Nursing</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Coverage of The Joint Commission&#x2019;s initiatives and roles in accreditation.</li><br> <li>Issues from the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) and magnet status.</li><br> <li>Discussions on delegation and how it relates to the management of unlicensed assistive personnel.</li><br> <li>Quantum physics theory and its relevance to nursing care.</li><br> <li>Nanotechnology and genomics and how they affect nursing.</li><br> <li>Data element sets and terminologies recognized by ANA.</li><br> <li>Staffing issues related to safety.</li><br> <li>Coverage of domestic violence issues.</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Evidence-Based Practice&#x201d; boxes provide examples of current evidence and include questions that help you apply to real life practice.</li><br> <li>&#x201c;Thought and Discussion&#x201d; questions test your understanding of the chapter objectives.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Jungle (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Jungle</em>'s influence has been extraordinary for a literary work. Upton Sinclair's 1906 landmark novel is widely credited with awakening the public fury that led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act (1906), a watershed in consumer protection and government legislation.</strong></p> This story of the immigrant experience in the harrowing Chicago stockyards has drawn comment from historians, policymakers, and literary critics, and it is a widely assigned teaching text. The novel is accompanied by an introduction and explanatory annotations.<br><br> "Contexts and Backgrounds" provides readers with an understanding of <em>The Jungle</em>'s disparate social, historical, political, and literary dimensions. Included are autobiographical selections by the author; contemporary perspectives on the meatpacking industry, including writings by Theodore Dreiser, Adolphe Smith, and J. Ogden Armour; and commentary on the living conditions of immigrant workers. Historical studies by Jimmy Skaggs, Rick Halpern, James Barrett, Robert M. Crunden, John Braeman, William Cronon, and Eric Schlosser address the central issues: slaughterhouse abuses, protectionism and The Beef Trust, muckraking, Progressivism, and consumer rights.<br><br> "Criticism" collects eight provocative readings of <em>The Jungle</em> as a literary text, as a historical document in its own right, as a contribution to Progressive-era muckraking, and as an important work in urban, economic, and labor history. Contributions include Jack London, Edward Clark Marsh, Winston Spencer Churchill, Walter Rideout, June Howard, Scott Derrick, Michael Brewster Folsom, and Christopher P. Wilson.<br><br> A Selected Bibliography is also included.</p><p>This book is perfect for AP classes and is often selected for inclusion on the AP exam. The notes, reading pointers, and vocabulary in this addition will also help students at a lower reading level get the most out of these classics.<p>An ardent activist, champion of political reform, novelist, and progressive journalist, Upton Sinclair is perhaps best known today for <i>The Jungle</i> his devastating expose of the meat-packing industry. A protest novel he privately published in 1906, the book was a shocking revelation of intolerable labor practices and unsanitary working conditions in the Chicago stockyards. It quickly became a bestseller, arousing public sentiment and resulting in such federal legislation as the Pure Food and Drug Act.-The brutally grim story of a Slavic family who emigrates to America, <i>The Jungle</i> tells of their rapid and inexorable descent into numbing poverty, moral degradation, and social and economic despair. Vulnerable and isolated, the family of Jurgis Rudkus struggles unsuccessfully to survive in an urban jungle.<br>A powerful view of turn-of-the-century poverty, graft, and corruption, this fiercely realistic American classic is still required reading in many history and literature classes. It will continue to haunt readers long after they've finished the last page."</p></p><h2>Heal Pelvic Pain: The Proven Stretching, Strengthening, and Nutrition Program for Relieving Pain, Incontinence,&amp; I.B.S, and Other Symptoms Without Surgery</h2><p><p><b>Bronze Medal Winner of a 2009 National Health Information Award</b> </p><p><b>Stop your pelvic pain . . . naturally!</b></p> <p>If you suffer from an agonizing and emotionally stressful pelvic floor disorder, including pelvic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis, prostatitis, incontinence, or discomfort during sex, urination, or bowel movements, it's time to alleviate your symptoms and start healing--without drugs or surgery.

These instantaneous art and nature activities encourage the understanding and appreciation of the earth and other living things.</p><p>Earthways is filled with hands-on nature crafts and seasonal activities to enhance environmental awareness. The activities are carefully written and beautifully illustrated. Children play with the elements of earth, air, and water. They develop a respect for nature, for the earth and for all living creatures. They experience the awe and wonder of the world around them. <p> Children learn firsthand about their dependence on the earth. They can learn how to take stalks of wheat and turn them into flour for making bread, how to be a creator and not just a consumer by making gifts, how to make butter and grow food (even in the city), and how to make outdoor playhouses. </p><p> Seasonal suggestions for creating a more earth-friendly home and classroom are also included, in addition to a comprehensive resource list. </p><p> Seasonal activities and crafts include: </p><p> Fall<br> Leaf Banners<br> Wheat Weaving<br> Leaf Crowns<br> Nature's People<br> Lanterns<br> </p><p> Winter<br> Caring for the Birds and Squirrels<br> Star Windows<br> Snow Scenes<br> Finger Knitting<br> Yarn Dolls </p><p> Spring<br> Round Wind Wands<br> Dish Gardens<br> Butterfly Pop-Up Cards<br> May Baskets<br> Pressed Flower Cards </p><p> Summer<br> Shooting Star Streamer Balls<br> Walnut Boats<br> Parachute People<br> Paper Birds<br> Moving Pictures</p>Dig your thumbnail into a dandelion stem. Watch the milky juice ooze out and feel it, sticky, on your fingers. Then thread the next hollow stem through the slit. Making flower wreaths used to be a wonder-filled way to spend a springtime afternoon! First, the gathering of the blossoms, then the task of wreath-making finally the transformation as you and your friends each assume a royal role, flower crowned for the pageant! Today these simple activities that brought children in close contact with their natural world have gone by the wayside. . . . <p> Now a new activity book designed for classroom use and for families has revived many old-fashioned nature activities and supplied an updated view on the importance of providing opportunities for children to interact with dirt and bugs and wool and plants real things as opposed to Barbie dolls and Ninja Turtle figures. Earthways is devoted primarily to craft ideas based on natural materials that can be frown, gathered, baked, woven, molded, and sometimes used in dramatic play. These crafts are unusual in that they can be shared in the doing and the giving and the eating. They can be enjoyed for the process and the product, which often turns out to be an object of simple beauty. . . . </p><p> the organization of this book makes it possible for a teacher or parent to move directly to a particular season to find a variety of activities, each geared to a minimum age level (i.e., age 3 and up). Every seasonal section begins with a short introduction chock-a-block full of ideas rooted in concern for a wide range of environmental issues. Special heading identify projects that "supply missing links,' helping children to make connections (e.g., tomatoes grow on vines, not in cans) and apply the skills they are learning as they garden and work with art materials. Throughout the book, each project is outlined in clear, concise language and illustrated with Donald cook's charming, soft black-and-white drawings that make it easy to follow the instructions. </p><p> A particularly noteworthy feature of Earthways is the resource section in the back, which contains useful lists of suppliers of art materials, garden tools, books, and toys. "Green" organizations are listed so that teachers can network their ecological concerns and acquire additional information. . . . </p><p> Petrash is Waldorf trained, and readers familiar with the Waldorf School and Rudolf Steiner's philosophy of education will recognize certain gentle components of that system of ideas: a project for sewing felt gnomes; the use of beeswax, watercolors, and carded wool; a preference for wooden toys. A sense of peace and centeredness is fostered throughout the book. . . . </p><p> As an introduction to another way of doing things, another way of viewing our world, this is a timely book, because it is solidly grounded in an awareness of the urgent need to do something to reverse the unfortunate results of our rampant materialism. Earthways makes the hopeful statement that one person can make a difference. By raising children with an understanding of the fragile beauty of their surroundings and helping them to assume a joyful responsibility for protecting this precious environment, a teacher, or a parent, can change the world. -- <i>Holistic Education Review</i><br><br>Early childhood author Carol Petrash has gathered more than 100 classroom activities designed to help preschool children grow in what Rachel Carson called "the sense of wonder." The difference from other children's craft books is signaled by the first chapter, which describes setting up an "earth-friendly" home and classroom and breaking the throw-away habit. The activities are organized by season and age groupings (3-plus to 5-plus). Making leaf crowns, nut people, seasonal gardens, drying and roasting pumpkin seeks (after the usual carving) are activities that can help children become creators in rhythm with the Earth in a way deliberately focused away from consumption of purchased materials. A section on creating a more natural outdoor play space in a bare asphalt schoolyard is especially interesting. A find resource for people working with young children. -- <i>Earth Ethics (Washington, D.C.)</i><br><br>Earthways is a treasure trove of developmentally-appropriate, imaginative activities in science, nature and art designed to empower young children to feel a joyous kinship with nature. Organized by seasons, this resource book devotes large sections to various nature crafts and natural toys with which young children can celebrate the gifts of the seasons and experience the rhythms and changes of their world. A sampling of seasonal crafts include wheat weaving and leaf crowns in the fall, star windows and snow scenes in the winter, dish gardens and press flower cards in the spring, and paper birds and walnut boats in the summer. Each craft is well-organized, clearly written, and beautifully enhanced by soft, pastel, pencil drawings. Although many of the hands-on activities and crafts are self-directed, some activities do need adult supervision (building an outdoor bean tepee playhouse using five-foot sticks or bamboo poles, or baking a berry shortcake or cobble). . . </p><p> Young children are born with the sense that their natural world is good and beautiful. Earthways provides simple and enjoyable activities for fostering these positive feelings for the earth. By engaging in these suggested activities, young children can increase their sense of natural wonder and learn to treat the earth not as a commodity to exploit and damage but as a cherished gift to love, respect and protect. -- <i>Chicago Metro AEYC Connections</i></p></p><h2>The Practice of Social Research, 13th Edition</h2><p>A straightforward, comprehensive, and approachable guide to research as practiced by social scientists, the Thirteenth Edition of Babbie&#39;s &#34;gold-standard&#34; text gives you the tools you need to apply research concepts practically, as both a researcher and a consumer.

The Yale edition alone has now sold over half a million copies, and the book is available worldwide in almost thirty languages. </p><p>Gombrich was of course the best-known art historian of his time, and his text suggests illustrations on every page. This illustrated edition of the <i>Little History</i> brings together the pellucid humanity of his narrative with the images that may well have been in his mind's eye as he wrote the book. The two hundred illustrations&#x2014;most of them in full color&#x2014;are not simple embellishments, though they are beautiful. They emerge from the text, enrich the author's intention, and deepen the pleasure of reading this remarkable work. </p><p>For this edition the text is reset in a spacious format, flowing around illustrations that range from paintings to line drawings, emblems, motifs, and symbols. The book incorporates freshly drawn maps, a revised preface, and a new index. </p><p>Blending high-grade design, fine paper, and classic binding, this is both a sumptuous gift book and an enhanced edition of a timeless account of human history.</p></p><p>The international bestseller available in English for the first time... <p>A Remembrance from Leonie Gombrich: </p><p>My grandfather Ernst Gombrich did not usually write for children.

New in this edition is a chapter on Records and Transcripts for Special Needs Students, quotes from college admissions counselors on what they want to see in the homeschool transcript, and more information on granting credit and weighted grades for AP and honors courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Transcripts Made Easy</i> provides clear, step-by-step instructions for creating several types of transcripts using simple word processing software that most people already know how to use. This compact book is all homeschool parents need to know about keeping records and creating a transcript for high school!</p><p>I remember the day my 16-year-old said, "Hey, mom-- I want to take some classes at the community college."&nbsp;Although he had already earned some college credit through CLEP exams, I didn't know if I was quite ready to send him off to college! However, dual credit really was the most practical way for him to take the higher math and lab sciences he needed in order to graduate, so we decided to start off with a couple of classes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem was, the deadline for applying to the college was only days away. I wasn't ready for this! I kept his high school records in a system of files and folders, but I hadn't consolidated any of it onto a transcript. That was on my 'round-to-it' list!&nbsp;I pulled out all the resources I owned on homeschooling through high school. Many of them were truly helpful in deciding what to study, but there wasn't any clear-cut instruction on how to create a homeschool transcript that would present my student in the best possible way to a college admissions department.&nbsp;I wanted to see actual transcript samples! I needed to know how to figure a grade point average, and how to grant credit for honors classes! I wanted to see how to include things like AP and CLEP exams, as well as volunteer work and hobbies.&nbsp;There wasn't time to find the kind of instruction book I wanted, though, as the application deadline was looming. I made the best transcript I could, formatted like my own high school and college transcripts, but it was at that point I realized that if there wasn't a good book on creating transcripts, I had to write one.&nbsp;So, just in time for my second son's college entrance, the first edition of <i>Transcripts Made Easy</i> was published. I found that high school paperwork can be pretty simple, especially if you start at the very beginning, and go step by step (isn't anything easier that way?).&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book, I've shown you how to start from the very beginning of high school, but because of my own experience, I've also shown you how to jump right in and pull together a transcript when you weren't expecting to.

As one of the launch titles in Atlantic Monthly Press&#x2019; Books That Changed the World&#x201d; series, Browne&#x2019;s history takes readers inside <i>The Origin of the Species</i> and shows why it can fairly claim to be the greatest science book ever published.</p><p>Janet Browne is the author of Charles Darwin: Voyaging and Charles Darwin: The Power of Place, a landmark two-volume biography of Charles Darwin.This brief book, written by the foremost biographer of Darwin, outlines the history of his landmark work, ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. Browne gives an overview of Darwin's life, discusses how he wrote the book (and what influence he had from others), how it was received and debated in Victorian England, and the book's legacy since its publication. Narrator Josephine Bailey reads with poise and aplomb, maintaining a didactic tone throughout. Her gentle, comforting British accent makes this an agreeable reading.

Born into an upper-class New York family, she broke with convention and became a professional writer, earning an enduring place as the grande dame of American letters. <p>This collection presents the finest of Wharton's achievement in short fiction, drawn from the more than eighty stories she published over the course of her career. Here, in settings familiar and exotic, are all of Wharton's characteristic qualities and themes: her candid exploration of relations between the sexes; her satire, sometimes gentle, sometimes despairing, of social class and its distinctions; her keen-eyed observation of the minutiae of character; her unflinching recognition of the power of conventional morality and the limits of passion, tempered by her delightful sense of play. </p><p>Here, in the second of two volumes, Wharton's humor is abundantly evident in sly and subtle stories like "Xingu" (in which a ladies' reading group is led to express its enthusiasm for an occult philosophy) and "Charm Incorporated" (about a mild-mannered Wall Street executive overwhelmed by his emigr� wife's needy but wonderful relatives). As always, Wharton's is a provocative voice on the subject of sexuality and women's roles. In "The Day of the Funeral," "Joy in the House," and "Atrophy," love and desire confront the demands of polite society; in "Roman Fever," a formal tour de force, two middle-aged women on holiday with their modern daughters revisit the fierce competitiveness of their own youth. Of particular interest are Wharton's stories of the uncanny and the supernatural, like the grisly "A Bottle of Perrier," set in the North African desert, and the chilling "All Souls'," written just before her death. An unacknowledged master of American horror fiction, Wharton's lucid prose makes all the more powerful her exploration of the irrational forces underlying ordinary life. </p><p>Also included in this edition are a chronology of Wharton's life, explanatory notes, and an essay on the texts. </p><p>Maureen Howard, editor of this volume, is the author of seven novels, including GRACE ABOUNDING, EXPENSIVE HABITS, NATURAL HISTORY, and A LOVER'S ALMANAC, and has taught at Columbia, Princeton, and Yale.

For nearly fifty years American intelligence agents had been decoding thousands of Soviet messages, uncovering an enormous range of espionage activities carried out against the United States during World War II by its own allies. So sensitive was the project in its early years that even President Truman was not informed of its existence. This extraordinary book is the first to examine the Venona messages&#x2014;documents of unparalleled importance for our understanding of the history and politics of the Stalin era and the early Cold War years.<br><br>Hidden away in a former girls&#x2019; school in the late 1940s, Venona Project cryptanalysts, linguists, and mathematicians attempted to decode more than twenty-five thousand intercepted Soviet intelligence telegrams. When they cracked the unbreakable Soviet code, a breakthrough leading eventually to the decryption of nearly three thousand of the messages, analysts uncovered information of powerful significance: the first indication of Julius Rosenberg&#x2019;s espionage efforts; references to the espionage activities of Alger Hiss; startling proof of Soviet infiltration of the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb; evidence that spies had reached the highest levels of the U.S. State and Treasury Departments; indications that more than three hundred Americans had assisted in the Soviet theft of American industrial, scientific, military, and diplomatic secrets; and confirmation that the Communist party of the United States was consciously and willingly involved in Soviet espionage against America. Drawing not only on the Venona papers but also on newly opened Russian and U. S. archives, John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr provide in this book the clearest, most rigorously documented analysis ever written on Soviet espionage and the Americans who abetted it in the early Cold War years. <br><br></p><p>With this new volume, John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr build upon their groundbreaking work in <i>The Secret World of American Communism</i> and solidify their reputations as the foremost historians of Soviet espionage in America. In <i>Venona</i>, they provide a detailed study of how the United States decrypted top-secret Communist cables moving between Washington and Moscow. This account, based on information unavailable to researchers for decades, reveals the full extent of the Communist spy network in the 1940s. At least 349 citizens, immigrants, and permanent residents of the United States had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence agencies, among them Harry White (assistant secretary of the treasury in FDR's administration and the Communists' highest-ranking asset) and State Department official Alger Hiss, whose association with the Soviets had been hotly debated since the moment he was first publicly accused in 1948.<p> "The Soviet assault was of the type a nation directs at an enemy state," write Haynes and Klehr. They go on to suggest that Venona's code-breaking "indicated that the Cold War was not a state of affairs that had begun after World War II but a guerilla action that Stalin had secretly started years earlier." Moreover, "espionage saved the USSR great expense and industrial investment and thereby enabled the Soviets to build a successful atomic bomb years before they otherwise would have." Haynes and Klehr deliver what is at once a real-life spy thriller and a vital piece of scholarship. A grand achievement. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>This extraordinary book is the first to examine the thousands of documents of the super-secret Venona Project-an American intelligence project that uncovered not only an enormous range of Soviet espionage activities against the United States during World War II but also the Americans who abetted this effort. The stunning revelations of the Venona papers, only made public in 1995, illuminate in a new way the Stalin era and early Cold War years. &#34;John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr have squeezed the pulp from five thousand pages of deciphered cables that verify the grim picture of the Communist underground given many decades ago by defectors such as Elizabeth Bentley and Whittaker Chambers.&#34;-Sam Tanenhaus, The New Republic</p><h2>Study Guide for Chemistry: The Central Science</h2><p><p>This book assists students through the text material with chapter overviews, learning objectives, a review of key terms, as well as self tests with answers and explanations.

What is distinctive about Christian theology? Why do these ideas matter? And the biggest question of all: Who cares? Key aspects of orthodox theology are seen as speculative and irrelevant to "authentic" Christianity and to personal spirituality. While not succumbing to the pragmatism of the age, this book shows that key elements of Christian theology ground an integrated worldview and are essential for spiritual formation.</p><p><em>Engaging Theology</em> is an introductory theology textbook that grounds a treatment of standard systematic topics in the wider context of life and practice and shows the relevance of each doctrine to the church. The book treats the essential doctrines of Christian orthodoxy by following the pattern of story, doctrinal exposition, theological relevance, and spiritual relevance:</p><ul><li>Story: Each chapter begins with a brief and engaging account of the historical situation out of which the doctrine arose or where it played an essential role in the development of the church, showing students that orthodox theology matters and introducing them to most of the key theologians in the history of the church.</li><li>Doctrinal Exposition: The heart of the chapter is exposition of key elements of the doctrine, highlighting core and debated elements while clarifying heterodox perspectives. Integrated with the narrative account this section also models the contextualized nature of theology. Each chapter includes biblical, historical, and contemporary views on the issue and notes key figures in the debates and their influence.</li><li>Theological Relevance: While theological relevance is clear throughout each chapter, this section highlights relevance to the modern setting and concerns, including interaction with heterodox and non-Christian faiths. It identifies current theological problems besetting the church and shows how a proper understanding and integration of orthodox theology addresses these problems. It also points to other problems the church is facing for interesting discussion starters.</li><li>Spiritual Relevance: Since orthodox theology has a direct influence on one's own spiritual formation and practice, each chapter concludes with practical encouragements and discussions about how each doctrine can be integrated in one's personal and corporate life.</li></ul><p><em>Engaging Theology</em> is ideal for students and everyday people living in a post Christian era to help them seriously engage with the Christian faith.</p></p><p><p>Ben C.

It includes reflections on the Bible by philosophers from Hobbes to Ricoeur; a compendium of modern biblical scholarship, focusing on topics such as the oral and the written, the composition of the Pentateuch, and the historical movement from covenant to canon; and a provocative sampling of comparative and literary approaches. The crucial presence of the Old Testament within English literature is represented by paraphrases and parables in verse and prose, and a recapitulatory conclusion brings the diverse perspectives of this millennial survey to bear on two of the Bible&#x2019;s most famous passages: the expulsion from the garden of Eden and the binding of Isaac.

Similarly, handmade garments have come to represent either a nostalgia for lost craftsmanship or, in haute couture, a cult of personality and affluence. Interviews with renowned and cutting-edge designers such as Sarah Burton, Karl Lagerfeld, and Miuccia Prada discuss how technology can blur the line between haute couture and pr�t-�-porter, and ultimately question the relevance of the distinction between hand and machine.&nbsp;<br> A tour de force in art book production, <i>Manus x Machina</i> incorporates two volumes into its innovative package. The main volume of the book includes a smaller hand-sewn booklet, which features the printed interviews, tucked into the back jacket flap. The outer cover of the main volume is made of three-ply plastic layers with high-frequency weld and die-cut flaps. The paperback cover is die cut (modelled on the punch cards used in the first automated weaving looms), and the main volume includes 5 different paper stocks and silver foil stamping, and is printed with both high-density and ultraviolet inks. The book&nbsp;also features new photography of extraordinary pieces, including intricate 19th-century floral designs by William Morris, handcrafted haute couture of designers such as Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen, and the specatuclar 3D creations of Iris van Herpen. &nbsp;</p><p>This beautifully illustrated book investigates the complex relationship between the artisanal and the technological in the world of fashion.<br><b>Andrew Bolton</b> is curator in charge of The Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><h2>The Wadsworth Anthology of Drama, 20th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>THE WADSWORTH ANTHOLOGY OF DRAMA, BRIEF EDITION offers you a bold and most distinguished introduction to drama packed with exciting plays usefully situated within their historical and cultural contexts.</p><p>W.

Al Vernacchio, a high school sexuality educator who holds a Master&#x2019;s degree in Human Sexuality from the University of Pennsylvania, has created a new category: sex-positive education. In <em>For Goodness Sex</em>, he refutes the &#x201c;disaster prevention&#x201d; model of sex ed, offering a progressive and realistic approach: Sexuality is a natural part of life, and healthy sexuality can only develop from a sex-positive, affirming appreciation.</p><p>Curious yet fearful of being judged, young people turn to peers, the Internet, and the media, where they receive problematic messages about sex: boys are studs, girls are sluts; real sex should be like porn; hookups are better than relationships. Without a broader understanding to offset these damaging perceptions, teenagers are dangerously unprepared intellectually and emotionally to grow and develop as sexual beings. <em>For Goodness Sex</em> offers the tools and insights adults need to talk young people and help them develop healthy values and safe habits. With real-life examples from the classroom, exercises and quizzes, and a wealth of sample discussions and crucial information, Vernacchio offers a guide to sex education for the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>Let's talk about sex.</p><p><em>We do it all the time, don't we?</em> We talk about our sex lives with friends; we gossip about celebrity hookups; we watch reality dating shows. Yet when it comes to talking to our kids&#x2014;many of whom are in sexually intimate relationships&#x2014;we are strangely silent. </p><p>But our kids are talking&#x2014;and seeing and listening and learning&#x2014;about sex every day.

Infamous crooks like William "Boss" Tweed dominate traditional histories of Tammany, distorting our understanding of a critical chapter of American political history. In <em>Machine Made</em>, historian and New York City journalist Terry Golway convincingly dismantles these stereotypes; Tammany's corruption was real, but so was its heretofore forgotten role in protecting marginalized and maligned immigrants in desperate need of a political voice. <p>Irish immigrants arriving in New York during the nineteenth century faced an unrelenting onslaught of hyperbolic, nativist propaganda. They were voiceless in a city that proved, time and again, that real power remained in the hands of the mercantile elite, not with a crush of ragged newcomers flooding its streets. Haunted by fresh memories of the horrific Irish potato famine in the old country, Irish immigrants had already learned an indelible lesson about the dire consequences of political helplessness. Tammany Hall emerged as a distinct force to support the city's Catholic newcomers, courting their votes while acting as a powerful intermediary between them and the Anglo-Saxon Protestant ruling class. In a city that had yet to develop the social services we now expect, Tammany often functioned as a rudimentary public welfare system and a champion of crucial social reforms benefiting its constituency, including workers' compensation, prohibitions against child labor, and public pensions for widows with children. Tammany figures also fought against attempts to limit immigration and to strip the poor of the only power they had&#x2015;the vote.</p><p>While rescuing Tammany from its maligned legacy, Golway hardly ignores Tammany's ugly underbelly, from its constituents' participation in the bloody Draft Riots of 1863 to its rampant cronyism. However, even under occasionally notorious leadership, Tammany played a profound and long-ignored role in laying the groundwork for social reform, and nurtured the careers of two of New York's greatest political figures, Al Smith and Robert Wagner. Despite devastating electoral defeats and countless scandals, Tammany nonetheless created a formidable political coalition, one that eventually made its way into the echelons of FDR&#x2019;s Democratic Party and progressive New Deal agenda.</p><p>Tracing the events of a tumultuous century, Golway shows how mainstream American government began to embrace both Tammany&#x2019;s constituents and its ideals. <em>Machine Made</em> is a revelatory work of revisionist history, and a rich, multifaceted portrait of roiling New York City politics in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Terry Golway was a journalist for thirty years, writing for the New York Observer, the New York Times, and other venues. He holds a PhD in American history from Rutgers University and is currently the director of the Kean University Center for History, Politics, and Policy in New Jersey.&#x201c;Golway&#x2019;s revisionist history chips away at Tammany Hall&#x2019;s calcified reputation and reveals that the Democratic machine that produced Boss Tweed-era corruption was also a force for worthy reform.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amy Finnerty, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Machine Made</em> tells an important but forgotten story&#x2015;of how American politics once worked for the poor and weak rather than, as today, only for the rich and powerful.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Kerby A. Miller, author of <em>Emigrants and Exiles</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Terry Golway&#x2019;s <em>Machine Made</em> delivers a refreshingly revisionist verdict on the Irish-dominated Democratic organization whose ring reverberated mightily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and then faded into a faint echo... If Boss Tweed and Richard Croker remain the defining faces of Tammany, Mr. Golway... advances a breezy and convincing case that Al Smith, Senators Robert F. Wagner and Herbert Lehman, and their mentors, Tom Foley and Charles Francis Murphy, deserve distinguished pedestals in that pantheon, too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sam Roberts, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A work that knowledgeably readjusts Tammany&#x2019;s reputation from a nest of corruption to an important crusader for the poor and downtrodden.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] valuable and enjoyable analysis describing how the political machine changed the role of government&#x2015;for the better to millions of disenfranchised recent American arrivals... [The] legacy Mr. Golway is so passionate about is undeniable. Tammany Hall, for all the many flaws of its leaders, helped create a welcoming environment for immigrants, making New York and the United States the beacon of hope for those seeking a better life... Now, that&#x2019;s a legacy worth remembering.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Fulop, <em>The New York Observer</em></strong></p><h2>Creating A Role</h2><p><em>Creating a Role</em>is the culmination of Stanislavski's masterful trilogy on the art of acting.<em> An Actor Prepares</em> <em></em>focused on the inner training of an actor's imagination. <em>Building a Character</em>detailed how the actor's body and voice could be tuned for the great roles he might fill. <br>This third volume examines the development of a character from the viewpoint of three widely contrasting plays: Griboyedov's Woe from Wit, Shakespeare's Othello, and Gogol's The Inspector General. Building on the first two books, Stanislavski demonstrates how a fully realized character is born in three stages: "studying it; establishing the life of the role; putting it into physical form."<br>Tracing the actor's process from the first reading to production, he explores how to approach roles from inside and outside simultaneously. He shows how to recount the story in actor's terms, how to create an inner life that will give substance to the author's words, and how to search into one's own experiences to connect with the character's situation. Finally, he speaks of the physical expression of the character in gestures, sounds, intonation, and speech. Throughout, a picture of a real artist at work emerges, sometimes failing, but always seeking truthful answers.</p><p>Constantin Stanislavski (1863-1938), arguably the most influential director in the history of the theater, was the founder of the renowned Moscow Art Theater. A pioneer of psychological realism and improvisation on the stage, he devoted his life to developing the performance techniques now emulated throughout the world.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Hospital With a Heart: Women Doctors and the Paradox of Separatism at the New England Hospital, 1862-1969</h2><p><i>Hospital with a Heart: Woman Doctors and the Paradox of Separatism at the New England Hospital, 1862-1969</i><br>258 pp. "...examines the dilemma that confronted nineteenth- and twentieth-century women doctors as they sought to preserve their all-women's institutions and to succeed in the male-dominated medical profession. It is at once women's history, medical history, institutional history, and a study of the impact of professionalization on women. This book tells the story of one of the most important all-women's hospitals in America, the New England Hospital for Women and Children. From its founding, the hospital provided women doctors with professional opportunities apart from men; eventually all-male medical institutions admitted women. The result, Drachman demonstrates, was a paradox: Separatism originally laid the path to equality for women in medicine, but integration gradually afforded a competing route to professional equality, challing the separtist traditions of women doctors. By the turn of the century, the New England Hospital confronted its most formidable challenge: the opportunities of integration."Keywords: MEDICAL MEDICINE WOMEN STUDIES WOMAN DOCTORS SEPARATISM NEW ENGLAND HOSPITAL AMERICAN HISTORY WOMENS MOVEMENT FIRST EDITION</p><p></p><h2>Watchman Nee: Man of Suffering (Heroes of the Faith)</h2><p>Watchman Nee is remembered for his leadership of an indigenous church movement in China, as well as for his books that continue to enrich Christians throughout the world.</p><p>Amidst the millions of committed Christians in each generation, a handful rise to special prominence.

He has published articles on various twentieth-century British and postcolonial writers. <br><br><b>From A. Michael Matin's Introduction to <i>Heart of Darkness and Selected Short Fiction</i><br><br></b><p><i>Heart of Darkness</i> (1899) is one of the most broadly influential works in the history of British literature. The novella&#x2019;s diverse attributes its rich symbolism, intricate plotting, evocative prose, penetrating psychological insights, broad allusiveness, moral significance, metaphysical suggestiveness have earned for it the admiration of literary scholars and critics, high school and college teachers, and general readers alike. Further, its impact can be gauged not only by the frequency with which it is read, taught, and written about, but also by its cultural fertility. It has heavily influenced works ranging from T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s landmark poem <i>The Waste Land</i> (1922), the manuscript of which has as its original epigraph a passage from the book that concludes with the last words of Conrad&#x2019;s antihero Kurtz, to Barbara Kingsolver&#x2019;s novel <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> (1998), which updates the tale to the years shortly before and after independence, when the Belgian Congo became the nation that is known today as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nor has its artistic influence been limited to literature; to cite only the most famous instance, it served as the basis for Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s film <i>Apocalypse Now</i> (1979), which transposes the story, in both place and time, to Vietnam and Cambodia during the American-Vietnamese War and recasts Kurtz as a renegade American colonel. Its various <i>homages</i> aside, in its original form <i>Heart of Darkness</i> has for several generations influenced the literary and moral outlook of innumerable readers. Yet while the text is widely recognized as an indictment of the greed and ruthlessness that generally drove European imperialism in Africa, most readers are unfamiliar with the fact that the setting is the event in imperial history so uniquely horrific in its sheer scale of suffering and death that it has been termed the African Holocaust. As Conrad himself would characterize the situation in the Congo nearly a quarter of a century after his novella was published, it was the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human conscience&#x201d; ( Geography and Some Explorers,&#x201d; p. 17).</p><p>Set during the era of heightened competition for imperial territories that historians have termed the New Imperialism, <i>Heart of Darkness</i> is loosely based on Conrad&#x2019;s experiences and observations during a six-month stint, in 1890, in the Congo as an employee of a Belgian company, the Soci�t� Anonyme Belge pour le Commerce du Haut-Congo. This was five years after the 1884 1885 Berlin Conference, a meeting of representatives of the European powers to establish the terms according to which much of the continent of Africa would be divided among them. During this meeting, King Leopold II of Belgium, skillfully playing the jealousies and fears of rival powers off one another, astonishingly managed to secure as his own personal property over 900,000 square miles of central Africa that is, a territory roughly seventy-five times the size of the diminutive country he ruled. Under humanitarian pretenses, Leopold&#x2019;s agents, who had begun the process of conquest several years earlier, effectively turned the so-called Congo Free State into an enormous forced labor camp for the extraction of ivory and, later, after the worldwide rubber boom in the early 1890s following the popularization of the pneumatic tire, rubber. In addition to outright murders, the slave labor conditions led to many deaths from starvation and disease as well as a steeply declining birth rate. Even during an era in which most Europeans viewed imperialism as legitimate, the appalling circumstances of Leopold&#x2019;s Congo (it would officially become a Belgian colony in 1908, and Leopold would die the following year never having so much as visited the territory) led to international outrage. Conservative demographic estimates place the region&#x2019;s depopulation toll between 1880 and 1920 at 10 million people that is, half of the total population with the worst of the carnage occurring between 1890 and 1910. Not much was known outside Africa about the conditions of Leopold&#x2019;s rule when Conrad was there, but in the several years before he began writing <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, in 1898, it became an international scandal, and regular reports appeared in the British and European press denouncing the abuses. Even before the publicity and protests, however (which would peak several years after the novella&#x2019;s publication), Conrad had seen enough on his own to be thoroughly disgusted.</p></p><h2>Modern Recording Techniques (Audio Engineering Society Presents)</h2><p><p>Master the tools and day-to-day practices of music recording and production.

We often think that these responses are hardwired, but fortunately this is not the case. Stoicism offers us an alternative approach. Plumbing the wisdom of one of the most popular and successful schools of thought from ancient Rome, philosopher William B. Irvine teaches us to turn any challenge on its head. The Stoic Challenge, then, is the ultimate guide to improving your quality of life through tactics developed by ancient Stoics, from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca to Epictetus.</p><p>This book uniquely combines ancient Stoic insights with techniques discovered by contemporary psychological research, such as anchoring and framing. The result is a surprisingly simple strategy for dealing with life&#x2019;s unpleasant and unexpected challenges&#x2015;from minor setbacks like being caught in a traffic jam or having a flight cancelled to major setbacks like those experienced by physicist Stephen Hawking, who slowly lost the ability to move, and writer Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffered from locked-in syndrome.</p><p>The Stoics discovered that thinking of challenges as tests of character can dramatically alter our emotional response to them. Irvine&#x2019;s updated &#x201c;Stoic test strategy&#x201d; teaches us how to transform life&#x2019;s stumbling blocks into opportunities for becoming calmer, tougher, and more resilient. Not only can we overcome everyday obstacles&#x2015;we can benefit from them, too.</p></p><p>William B. Irvine is professor of philosophy at Wright State University.

The best way to overcome it is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river: small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past rocks and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being.

Asian &amp; Asian American Studies. LGBTQIA Studies. Women's Studies. SMALL BEAUTY tells the story of Mei, a mixed race trans woman managing the death of her cousin, the ways she contorts to navigate racism and transphobia, and her desire for community as she takes an opportunity to leave the city and revisit a town from her family's past, where she discovers queer family history while parsing through her own anger and trauma. Cycling through time, points of view, and rural and city life, the novel introduces us to Mei's community in fictional Dundurn and Herbertsville, loosely based on Southern Ontario places: Annette and Connie, other Asian trans women from the drop-ins; Sandy, Mei's older cousin and constant (if aggressive) support; Diane, an older lesbian with a pick-up and secret links to Mei's blood family; and Nelson, a presence lost before found, whose story is told in pictures sewn into a suitcase.

The U.S. government has consistently denied there ever was such an incident or group. Friedman attempts to authenticate purported MJ-12 documents that mysteriously appeared in 1984 and 1994. He also refutes arguments by debunkers such as Carl Sagan and Phillip Klass and criticizes the findings in Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmitt's recent The Truth About the UFO Crash in Roswell (LJ 6/1/94). Included here for the first time is part of a 1984 "Special Operations Manual" for the recovery and disposal of extraterrestrial entities and technology. If authenticated, it would lend credence to Friedman's belief in a governmental cover-up he terms a "cosmic Watergate." While this book is speculative to some degree, Friedman operates mostly as a scientist, carefully weighing all evidence before coming to a conclusion. Recommended for public and academic libraries.?Gary D. Barber, SUNY at Fredonia Lib.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Majestic-12 documents are controversial adjuncts to the now famous UFO crash at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. Obtained under unusual circumstances, they refer to a top-secret research operation created by President Truman to coordinate the study of debris and alien bodies recovered from the crash site. Although the documents are considered by many historians and ufologists to be hoaxes, Friedman has studied them intensively and answers criticisms in great detail. He reviews the most recently discovered document, an alleged 1954 manual for the recovery and disposal of extraterrestrial entities and technology, as well as the notorious "alien autopsy" film that was broadcast on the Fox network in 1995. This book will delight those who can't get enough of crashed saucers and government cover-ups. <i>George Eberhart</i></p><h2>Practice Makes Perfect: Spanish Conversation, Premium Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>Perfect the Art of Conversation in Spanish!</b></p> <p>Nervous that you&#x2019;re not ready to strike up a conversation with a native Spanish speaker?

Yet I smell the blooming evening primrose and hear the throaty chirps and creaky rattles of the purple martins flitting home across the marsh. I see their sleek iridescent bodies gliding against the bloodred sunset sky, through the blackened Corinthian columns and crumbling chimneys of Carrowmore. The house is named after a legendary thin place, far away in Ireland. I can hear Ceecee&#x2019;s voice again in my head, telling me what the name means, and why I should stay away. But as with most things Ceecee has ever told me, I didn&#x2019;t listen.</p><p>Carrowmore and I are both in ruins now, with wrinkles in our plaster and faults in our foundations. It&#x2019;s oddly fitting that I should die in this house. I almost died here once before, when I was a little girl. I wonder if the house has been waiting for its second chance.</p><p>The thrum of Ellis&#x2019;s 1966 Mustang rumbles in the distance. If I could move, I&#x2019;d run out the front door and down the walk before he can honk the horn and irritate Daddy. There&#x2019;s nothing Daddy dislikes more than Ellis&#x2019;s long hair and that car.</p><p>But I can&#x2019;t move. All I remember is stepping on a soft spot in the old wooden floor, then hearing the splintering of ancient, rotten wood. Now I&#x2019;m lying here, broken in so many pieces.</p><p>My brain reminds me that Ellis has been gone forty years. His precious car sold before he shipped out to Fort Gordon in 1969. Still, the acrid scent of exhaust wafts over me, and I wonder with an odd hopefulness whether it&#x2019;s Ellis, coming for me after all this time.</p><p>There&#x2019;s something soft and silky crumpled in my fist. My fingers must have held tight when I first felt the ancient floor give way beneath my feet.</p><p>A hair ribbon. I&#x2019;d pulled it from Larkin&#x2019;s dresser drawer. My sweet baby girl. The daughter who&#x2019;d always desperately wanted to be just like me. Almost as desperately as I wanted her to be different. I wanted her to be happy. Not that Larkin is a girl anymore. She&#x2019;s too old for ribbons, but I kept everything in her room just the same as she left it, hoping one day she&#x2019;d come home for good. Decide it was time to forgive all of us. To forgive herself.</p><p>I remember now using a black marker to write down the length of the ribbon, the letters bold and big, shouting my anger with silent strokes. But that&#x2019;s the only clear memory I have. I can&#x2019;t feel that anger anymore. Nor remember the reason for it. I must have driven here, but I don&#x2019;t remember. Just me writing on that ribbon, and then here, falling. My brain is playing tricks on me, recalling things from long ago with the clarity of hindsight, yet leaving what happened only thirty minutes ago in a dark closet behind a locked door.</p><p>Bright pops of air explode inside my skull. Streaks of light like shooting stars flit past my line of vision. I think they&#x2019;re the purple martins of my past, constant as the moon and stars in my memories. And then the pain comes, white-hot and precise, settling at the base of my head, then traveling upward, a large hand slowly constricting my brain.</p><p>Then darkness covers me like a mask, and everything fades away. Except for the engine fumes of an old car, and the raucous chirp of a thousand martins coming home to roost.</p><p></p><br><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Larkin</p><p>2010</p><p>The introductory notes to an old song distracted me for a moment, causing me to glance up from my computer and look around with an oddly satisfying appreciation. I loved my desk. Not because it was beautiful or rare&#x2014;it was neither&#x2014;but because of its simple functionality.</p><p>It was no different from the metal desks of the other copywriters at Wax &amp; Crandall, the ad agency where I&#x2019;d worked for the past five years, except mine was devoid of all personal effects. No frames, no kitschy knickknacks or rubber-band balls. Nothing tacked up on the walls of my cubicle, either, or mementos of my four years spent at Fordham earning my undergraduate degree. My one concession to my past was a gold chain with three charms on it that I never removed but kept tucked inside my neckline.</p><p>I loved that nobody asked me why I seemed to have no past. This was New York, after all, where people seemed to care only about where you were going, not where you&#x2019;d been. They just assumed that I had no husband or significant other, no children or siblings. Which was correct. The people I worked with knew I was from somewhere down south only because every once in a while, a long consonant or dropped syllable found its way into my sentences. I never mentioned that I was born and raised in Georgetown, South Carolina, or that if I closed my eyes long enough, I could still smell the salt marshes and the rivers that surrounded my hometown. My coworkers probably believed that I hated my home and that was why I left. And in that assumption, they&#x2019;d be wrong.</p><p>There are reasons other than hating a place that make a person leave.</p><p>&#x201c;Knock, knock.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned to see Josephine&#x2014;not &#x201c;Jo&#x201d; or &#x201c;Josie,&#x201d; but &#x201c;Josephine&#x201d;&#x2014;standing at the entrance to my cubicle. The lack of a door meant people had to improvise when they wanted to enter. She was one of our account executives, a nice enough person if she liked you but someone to avoid if she didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you busy?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>My fingers were at that moment poised above my keyboard, which made her question unnecessary, but Josephine wasn&#x2019;t the type to notice such things. She was one of those women who commanded attention because of the way she looked&#x2014;petite, with sun-streaked brown hair, and perpetually tanned&#x2014;so it had become customary for her to get what she wanted with just a smile.</p><p>I was streaming Pandora on my computer, and the song playing would distract me until I could name it. It was an old habit I&#x2019;d never been able to break. &#x201c;Dream On.&#x201d; Aerosmith. I smiled to myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Josephine said, and I realized I&#x2019;d spoken aloud.</p><p>I thought back to her question. &#x201c;Actually&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; I said, but as I began, the vague feeling of disquiet that had been hovering over me since I&#x2019;d awakened exploded into foreboding.</p><p>Ceecee would have said it was just somebody walking over my grave, but I knew it was the dream I&#x2019;d remembered from the night before. A dream of falling, my arms and legs flailing, waiting to hit an invisible bottom.</p><p>Ignoring my body language, Josephine stepped closer. &#x201c;Because I wanted to ask you about a dream I had last night. I was running, but it felt as if my feet were stuck in glue.&#x201d;</p><p>I let my wrists rest on the edge of my desk but didn&#x2019;t swivel my chair, hoping she&#x2019;d take the hint. &#x201c;You can Google it, you know. You can find out a lot about dreams on the Internet. It&#x2019;s handy that way.&#x201d; I kept my hands poised near the keyboard.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know, but I just thought it would be quicker if I asked you. Since you&#x2019;re the expert.&#x201d; She beamed a smile at me.</p><p>With a sigh, I turned around to face her. I wasn&#x2019;t an expert&#x2014;only well-read on the subject after years spent trying to analyze my mother&#x2019;s dreams in an attempt to understand her better. As my delusional childhood self, I&#x2019;d thought knowing what was in my mother&#x2019;s head would help me unlock the reasons for the sadness and restlessness behind her eyes. I&#x2019;d hoped she would be so grateful, she&#x2019;d include me in her various quests for peace and beauty. I&#x2019;d failed, but in the process, I&#x2019;d discovered an avid interest in these windows into our subconscious. It gave me something to talk about at the rare parties I attended, a parlor trick I could pull out when conversation faltered.</p><p>&#x201c;There are probably a million interpretations, but I think it might mean that some ambition in your life, like your career or love life, isn&#x2019;t progressing as you&#x2019;d like it to be, and you feel as if something were holding you back.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine blinked at me for several seconds, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure whether she either didn&#x2019;t understand or was in complete denial that anything could ever hold her back. &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Josephine said, smiling brightly again, any self-doubt quickly erased. &#x201c;You going with the group from sales to the Hamptons for the weekend?&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, eager to get back to work. I was at the gym every afternoon at five thirty, meaning I had to leave at five. Though it kept me in shape, the habit didn&#x2019;t allow for much after-hours socializing. Not that I didn&#x2019;t like my coworkers&#x2014;I did. They were a fun, creative, and young group, including a smattering of millennials who didn&#x2019;t act too much like millennials. I just found that I preferred socializing with them in an office setting, making it easier to escape back to my desk if any question went beyond which apartment I lived in and whether I preferred the subway or cabbing it.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll stay in the city.&#x201d; It never ceased to amaze me that people who complained about the crowded city always seemed to gravitate toward the same beaches at the same time with the same people from whom they were trying to escape. &#x201c;The water will be ice-cold, anyway. It&#x2019;s still only April.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine scrunched up her nose, and I noticed how nothing else wrinkled. She said she used Botox only as a preventative measure, but from what I could tell, she was well on her way to looking like one of the gargoyle women I saw shopping in the high-end stores on Fifth Avenue. As Ceecee would say, it just wasn&#x2019;t natural.</p><p>&#x201c;Not any colder than usual,&#x201d; Josephine insisted. &#x201c;Come on. It&#x2019;ll be fun. We&#x2019;ve got a huge house in Montauk. There&#x2019;re two queen beds in my room, if you don&#x2019;t mind sharing with me. You could analyze everyone&#x2019;s dreams.&#x201d;</p><p>I was tempted. I&#x2019;d never been part of a group or hung out with girls who rented houses together and took trips on the weekends. For a brief time in elementary school, I&#x2019;d had a cluster of friends my age, but by the time we reached middle school, they&#x2019;d formed their own smaller groups, none of which included me. I&#x2019;d always had Mabry and her twin brother, Bennett, though. Our mothers were best friends, and we&#x2019;d been bathed in the same bathtub when we were babies. That right there made us best friends, whether or not we ever acknowledged it. At least until our senior year in high school, when we&#x2019;d stopped being friends at all.</p><p>The memory made it easier for me to shake my head. &#x201c;Thanks for the invite, but I&#x2019;ll stay home. I might rearrange my furniture. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Josephine gave me an odd look. &#x201c;Sure. Oh, well, maybe it&#x2019;s for the best. I don&#x2019;t want to be the one standing next to you wearing a bikini&#x2014;that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For the record, I don&#x2019;t own a bikini.&#x201d; I was more a T-shirt-and-boy-shorts type girl. &#x201c;But thanks for asking. Maybe next time, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>My cell phone buzzed where it lay faceup on my desk. I didn&#x2019;t have a picture or a name stored in the directory, but I didn&#x2019;t need to. It was the first cell phone number I&#x2019;d ever memorized. When I didn&#x2019;t move to pick it up, Josephine pointed to it with her chin. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to get that?&#x201d;</p><p>It was oddly telling that she didn&#x2019;t excuse herself to give me privacy. I reached over and silenced it. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ll call him back later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Him?&#x201d; she asked suggestively.</p><p>&#x201c;My father.&#x201d; I never took his calls, no matter how many times he tried. When I&#x2019;d first come to New York, the calls were more frequent, but over the past year or so, they&#x2019;d tapered down to about one per week&#x2014;sprinkled across different days and times, as if he were trying to catch me off guard. He wasn&#x2019;t giving up. And neither was I. I&#x2019;d inherited the Lanier bullheadedness from him, after all.</p><p>&#x201c;So, you have a father.&#x201d; Josephine looked at me expectantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t everyone?&#x201d;</p><p>The phone started buzzing again. I was about to toss it in my drawer, when I noticed it was a different number, another number that I knew and received calls from frequently, but never when I was at work. It was Ceecee, the woman who&#x2019;d raised my mother, who was pretty much my grandmother in standing. She was too in awe of my working in New York City to ever want to interrupt me during office hours. Unless there was a good reason.</p><p>I picked up the phone. &#x201c;Please excuse me,&#x201d; I said to Josephine. &#x201c;I need to take this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Josephine said. &#x201c;Just know that if your body is ever found behind some Dumpster in Queens, we won&#x2019;t know who to call.&#x201d;</p><p>Ignoring her, I turned my back to the cubicle opening. &#x201c;Ceecee?&#x201d; I spoke into the phone. &#x201c;Is everything all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sweetheart. I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s not.&#x201d; Her voice sounded thick, as if she had a cold. Or had been crying. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your mama.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat up straighter. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with Mama?&#x201d; I tried to prepare myself for her answer. Ivy Lanier was anything but predictable. But anything I could have imagined couldn&#x2019;t have prepared me for what Ceecee said next.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s missing. Nobody&#x2019;s seen her since yesterday morning. Your daddy said when he got home from work yesterday that she and her car were gone. We&#x2019;ve called all of her friends, but nobody&#x2019;s seen her or heard from her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday morning? Have you called the police?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;the minute I heard. The sheriff has filed a report, and he&#x2019;s got people looking for her.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind filled and emptied like the marsh at the turning of the tides, enough stray bits clinging that I could form my first question. &#x201c;Where was she yesterday morning?&#x201d;</p><p>A pause. &#x201c;She was here. She&#x2019;s been here just about every day for the last month, refinishing her daddy&#x2019;s old desk out in the garage. She&#x2019;d come inside&#x2014;I only know that because she left the kitchen a mess, the drawers yanked out. Like she was looking for something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you have no idea what?&#x201d; The thread of panic that had woven into my voice surprised me.</p><p>There was a longer pause this time, as if Ceecee were considering the question. And the possible answer. &#x201c;I thought she might have wanted more spare rags for the refinishing. I keep a bag on the floor of the pantry. It&#x2019;s empty, though. She must have forgotten she&#x2019;d used them all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But she was looking through the drawers and cabinets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. When I saw her car pull away, I thought she was just running to the hardware store. But the police have checked&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t go there. Your daddy and I are beside ourselves with worry.&#x201d;</p><p>I closed my eyes, anticipating her next words.</p><p>&#x201c;Please come home, Larkin. I need someone here. I&#x2019;m afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her voice caught, and she was silent.</p><p>&#x201c;Ceecee, you know Mama is always off in one direction or another. You&#x2019;ve always called her a dandelion seed&#x2014;remember? This wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time she&#x2019;s run off without explanation.&#x201d; The words sounded hollow, even to me. My dream returned to me suddenly, jerking me backward as if I&#x2019;d finally hit the ground, the air knocked from my lungs.</p><p>&#x201c;She always comes back the same day,&#x201d; Ceecee said fiercely. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve checked all the roads within a hundred miles of here. Your daddy&#x2019;s driven Highway Seventeen all the way up to Myrtle Beach, as far south as Charleston.&#x201d; She paused again. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell you this, but I had a dream last night. I dreamed I was falling.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at the black letters against the white background on my computer screen, lines and symbols that suddenly meant nothing at all. &#x201c;Did you...</p></p><h2>CliffsNotes CSET Multiple Subjects: Fourth Edition, Revised (CliffsNotes Test Prep)</h2><p><b>Test prep for California's CSET Multiple Subjects test, now aligned to Common Core</b><br><br> Common Core meets California's CSET Multiple Subjects exam in this revised CliffsNotes CSET Multiple Subjects test-prep product.

Each book tells the story of one of America&#x2019;s icons in an entertaining, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers, those who aren&#x2019;t quite ready for the Who Was series. Each book focuses on a particular character trait that made that role model heroic. For example, Abraham Lincoln always spoke up about fairness, and thus he led the country to abolish slavery. This book follows him from childhood to the presidency, including the Civil War and his legendary Gettysburg Address.<br> &nbsp;<br> This engaging series is the perfect way to bring American history to life for young children, and to inspire them to strive and dream.</p><p>Brad Meltzer is a #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of adult thrillers (including <i>The Inner Circle </i>and its recent sequel, <i>The Fifth Assassin</i>). His two nonfiction gift books, <i>Heroes for My Son </i>and <i>Heroes for My Daughter </i>were <i>New York Times </i>Bestsellers as well, and he has won the prestigious Eisner Award for his comic book work, <i>Justice League of America. </i>Brad is also the host of the History Channel TV show <i>Brad Meltzer's Decoded</i>.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Imagine, if you will, two famous Americans whose childhood selves were strong and portentous of their future adult lives but whose bodies stayed small and childlike as they achieved their incredible feats. Meltzer has chosen to portray these iconic figures in this way, perhaps in the hopes that modern-day kids will more easily identify with them. Both narratives are told in first person, which raises doubts as to whether they could truly be called biographies. For example, Amelia Earhart recounts an incident in which she and her sister built a ramp off the side of a shed so they could ride a cart off the roof. Her brother comes along and asks, "Amelia, are you sure this is a good idea?" She replies, "This isn't a good idea. It's the BEST idea!" Such conversations and the lack of resources calls the books' informational value into question. On the other hand, they each talk about the character traits that made Earhart and Lincoln wonderful role models and determined in their life pursuits. The illustrations, while a bit odd, are also rather charming. Their comiclike nature and the brief, readable text will appeal to young readers. Adults who read these books with children will have plenty to discuss regarding the hard work, persistence, and determination each person showed, as long as it's clear that the books themselves are fictionalized.&#x2014;Maggie Chase, Boise State University, ID</p><h2>Sacred Geometry and Magical Symbols</h2><p>All symbols originate in geometric figures which give form to the observed world as well as the microcosm and macrocosm. Sacred geometry is a teaching that focuses on geometric proportions and patterns in nature. The knowledge of magical symbols and sacred geometry was revered and preserved by many ancient civilisations including those in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India and Greece. Magical symbols and geometry worked together as keys to understanding nature and the philosophical meaning of existence.<br>This book is a simple guide to understanding magical symbols by taking in account their original geometric patterns and mythological correlations. Each chapter addresses a different geometric figure and its derived magical symbols. It's a journey from the source shape of the circle, the well from which the other shapes arise, to the Tree of Life where they all connect.</p><p></p><h2>Pocket Guide to the Rosary</h2><p><p><b><i>The print edition now includes which day of the week to pray which mysteries.</i></b></p> <i>Pocket Guide to the Rosary</i> helps Catholics deepen their prayer life and improve their ability to pray what St. Padre Pio called <i>the weapon of our times</i>, the Rosary. <p> Drawing from the writings of the saints, the Bible, and Catholic tradition, Matt Fradd has produced a book that every Catholic should read. </p> Its small size makes it easy to carry to adoration, keep around for family Rosary night, or hand out at your parish.

How I would love my son so much that I would feel like my heart would burst. And they were right. The moment the nurse laid my newborn son&#x2019;s bare body on my chest and I felt his heart beat against mine, I knew there was nothing in this world I wouldn&#x2019;t do for him. My instantaneous love for him overwhelmed me.<br> <br>That newborn baby is now a teenager, and I am still caught off guard by how the very sight of him, along with his three younger brothers, slays me.<br> <br>However, what I don&#x2019;t remember anyone telling me before my first son was born is that motherhood would not only enlarge my heart but it would also expose all my weaknesses and inadequacies, and that there would be days when I&#x2019;d feel so desperate that I wouldn&#x2019;t even recognize myself. I didn&#x2019;t see that coming. I didn&#x2019;t expect that motherhood would reveal both the beautiful and the not-so-beautiful parts of my heart.<br> What I Wish I&#x2019;d Known<p></p> <br>I recently attended a baby shower for a young woman named Nicole. She was a soon-to-be first-time mom and a woman I very much admire and adore. To call her wise beyond her years would be an understatement.<br> <br>The shower was a joyous occasion, as all baby showers are, but the joy at this shower was palpable. Nicole and her husband, Jimmy, had long prayed and hoped for this &#x201c;miracle baby&#x201d; whom we were all eager to embrace and celebrate.<br> <br>However, just about halfway through the celebration, I felt a strong inclination to pull my friend aside and warn her that parenting isn&#x2019;t all petits fours, pink lemonade, and filtered Instagram photos. Perhaps it was because I was on the tail end of a very defeating week of parenting. The kind where my joy was lost in the battles. Failures outweighed victories. Fighting trumped kindness. All my intentionality felt worthless. And I was mentally and physically wiped out.<br> <br>You&#x2019;ll be happy to know I didn&#x2019;t ruin the shower. I focused on the gift this child will be to Nicole and Jimmy. But soon thereafter, Nicole and I grabbed coffee and, because I love her, I shared with her some of the things I wish I&#x2019;d known as a new mom.<br> <br>I said things like:<br> <br>This parenting thing is hard. Really hard. And there will be a lot of mornings when you want to pull the covers over your head and stay in bed because you don&#x2019;t have the mental, physical, or emotional strength to meet the demands of the day and be the mom you want to be.<br> <br>And when you do muster up the strength to put your feet on the floor and take that one next step, you will want to say, with the little energy you can summon, &#x201c;Who wants to play hide and seek? Doesn&#x2019;t that sound like fun! Okay, so you go hide, and be sure to find a really great spot where I&#x2019;ve never found you before, and Mommy will come look for you after I count to five hundred.&#x201d; Yes, you will do this because you are falling apart. It won&#x2019;t mean you don&#x2019;t love your children with all you have. It just means you&#x2019;re human. And that&#x2019;s okay.<br> <br>And you will make mistakes. Lots of them. And you will have regrets. Big ones. And you will need Jesus like you&#x2019;ve never needed Him before!<br> <br>But, girlfriend, what I most want to tell you is this: On the days when you feel like you&#x2019;re not enough, hold on tight to the truth that you have a Savior who is enough. And what is hard for you is not hard for Him! So run to Him. Rely on Him. Depend on Him.<br> <br>Isn&#x2019;t that what we most want to hear?<br> <br>We all need another mom to affirm the &#x201c;crazy&#x201d; we feel. We need to know that we&#x2019;re not the only one whose fierce love for our children coexists with feelings of failure and desperation.<br> <br>We all need another mom to remind us&#x2014;over and over again&#x2014;that we have a powerful God who has given us His perfect son, Jesus Christ. And He is our enough.<br> The Relief God Promises<p></p> <br>When we&#x2019;re feeling pushed far beyond our human limitations, and we look in the mirror only to find our face worn and weary with the day&#x2019;s demands, we can turn to God&#x2019;s Word and read the relief God promises.<br> <br>O Jacob, how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles?<br> <br>O Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?<br> <br>Have you never heard?<br> <br>Have you never understood?<br> <br>The Lord is the everlasting God,<br> <br>the Creator of all the earth.<br> <br>He never grows weak or weary.<br> <br>No one can measure the depths of his understanding.<br> <br>He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless.<br> <br>Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion.<br> <br>But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength.<br> <br>They will soar high on wings like eagles.<br> <br>They will run and not grow weary.<br> <br>They will walk and not faint.<br> <br>(40: 27&#x2013;31 NLT)<br> <br>Did you get all that? There&#x2019;s a lot of relief packed into this passage:<br> <br>�&nbsp;God does not lose track of us.<br> <br>�&nbsp;God very much cares what happens to us.<br> <br>�&nbsp;God&#x2019;s knowledge and understanding cannot be measured.<br> <br>�&nbsp;God never grows weak or weary.<br> <br>�&nbsp;He knows everything. Every. Single. Thing.<br> <br>�&nbsp;He gives power to the weak.<br> <br>�&nbsp;He gives strength to the powerless.<br> <br>What we learn through the words of Isaiah is that who God is, which is sovereign, and what He gives us, which is grace, is enough. And He wants us to trust Him. When we&#x2019;re exhausted&#x2014;both mentally and physically&#x2014;He wants us to rely on Him to be all that we need. He wants us to recognize that parenting is actually meant to&#x2014;designed to&#x2014;deepen our dependence on Him. He is wooing our hearts closer and closer to His in and through our kids.<br> <br>God actually has a simple but profound message for us regarding our quest to be enough. In Psalms 46:10, His voice breaks through and proclaims, &#x201c;Be still and know that I am God.&#x201d;<br> <br>I have clung to this verse for years. In fact, I most love the New American Standard translation that says, &#x201c;Cease striving and know that I am God.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ve recently discovered something that makes this verse even more meaningful to me. The Hebrew meaning for &#x201c;be still&#x201d; is &#x201c;enough.&#x201d; Oh, how profound this is for our lives and for our parenting. He is saying, Enough of trying to be enough!<br> The Squeeze of Vertical and Horizontal Pressure<p></p> <br>Whether you&#x2019;re in the middle of raising tiny babies, tantruming toddlers, tenacious teenagers, or adult kids, you&#x2019;re likely well acquainted with the hopeless feeling of being &#x201c;not enough&#x201d; for your children. But here&#x2019;s the thing. As we seek to overcome the pressure we feel to be enough for our kids, we also have to take an honest look at the pressure we feel to be enough for God. See, most of us aren&#x2019;t just trying to be enough for our kids, which is the horizontal pressure we feel. We&#x2019;re also trying to be enough for God, and that&#x2019;s the vertical pressure I want us to talk about honestly on this journey together.<br> <br>Do you ever fear (or maybe the better question is, how often do you fear?) that you are disappointing God with your personal failures and your parenting mistakes? That pressure usually leads us to do one of two things. With clenched fists and gritted teeth, we try harder to keep God happy and not lose His love and acceptance. Or, we give up because we assume God has given up on us. Neither of which draws us closer to His heart, where He wants us to hear Him saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need you to impress me. I want you to rely on me.&#x201d;<br> <br>And when it comes to parenting&#x2014;where we experience the horizontal pressure to prove we&#x2019;re enough&#x2014;we just keep searching for newer and better ways to control our child&#x2019;s behavior, secure our child&#x2019;s success, or change our child&#x2019;s heart. And none of it works&#x2014;at least, not for long.<br> <br>Is it any wonder that under all this pressure we crack?<br> <br>Are you tired of being the mom who is barely stumbling along, crushed under the pressure to be &#x201c;enough&#x201d;? Are you tired of feeling that you can&#x2019;t catch your breath, can&#x2019;t keep up, and can&#x2019;t be all that your children need you to be? Are you tired of being tired?<br> <br>I get it.<br> The Enough-ness of Christ<p></p> <br>I spent entirely too long trying to prove to myself, to God, and to everybody around me that I was enough. Only in recent years have I begun to understand what Paul meant when he said that in our pursuit to be enough, we deny and reject the work of Christ&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as if &#x201c;Christ died for nothing&#x201d; (Galatians 2:21 NIV). In other words, if we ever had a shot at being enough, then everything Jesus endured on our behalf to reconcile us to God was pointless. God never called us to be enough. Not for Him and not for our kids. Not for our spouse and not for our church. He calls us to be loved. To be His beloved. This title has been gifted to us and can never be taken away from us. All because of Jesus. So we can stop trying to be enough because Jesus was, and is, our more than enough.<br> <br>So the next time we wrestle with the question &#x201c;Am I enough?&#x201d; rather than try to justify our enough-ness, let&#x2019;s see our question as a cue to recall the preeminence of Christ in our lives and our daily mothering. We can unashamedly proclaim, as Charles Spurgeon once said, &#x201c;I have a great need for Christ. I have a great Christ for my need.&#x201d; It is only in this confession&#x2014;&#x201c;I have a great need for Christ&#x201d;&#x2014;that we are relieved from the guilt of not being all we desire to be for our kids. It is then that we become grateful for all that Christ already is for them.<br> <br>Jesus freed us from trying to prove that we are enough. He lived a sinless life, died a sinless death, conquered the grave, and has freely given us His perfect record (Romans 3:23&#x2013;25 NIV).When we are in Christ, there is nothing to prove. Let that sink into your weary and worn-out soul.<br> <br>We get to rest in the assurance of God&#x2019;s grace and His sovereignty over us and over the kids we long to love and lead well. We are free!<br> An INvitation<p></p> <br>Rest assured, when I say &#x201c;We are free&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;ve been given an excuse to be a lazy or lousy parent. This is not a permission slip to give up. This is not an out. This is an in.<br> <br>An invitation to:<br> <br>�&nbsp;lay down what God has not asked us to carry so we thrive in what He has<br> <br>�&nbsp;embrace our significance in light of God&#x2019;s sovereignty<br> <br>�&nbsp;discover God&#x2019;s acceptance of us and affection for us, just as we are<br> <br>�&nbsp;receive God&#x2019;s grace so we can reflect God&#x2019;s heart to our kids<br> <br>�&nbsp;stop trying so hard and start enjoying our kids more<br> <br>�&nbsp;weave grace into how we discipline our kids<br> <br>�&nbsp;trust God with the kids He has entrusted to us<br> <br>�&nbsp;become more of the moms we long to be for our kids<br> <br>An invitation to trust that &#x201c;everything that goes into a life of pleasing God has been miraculously given to us by getting to know, personally and intimately, the One who invited us to God.

Writing is her passion, and words flow out of her pencil onto the paper bags that Papi brings his rum home in, onto napkins, onto gray shop paper. In the Rep�blica Dominicana, however, only the President can write books. But as Mami sighs and says, "Ana Rosa, there always has to be a first person to do something." These supportive words are difficult for her mother to muster, as everyone on the island knows too well that writers do not have freedom of expression--and in their political climate "silence was self-defense."<p> When the chilling news arrives that the government wants to buy all the land in the village to build hotels and generate more tourism, people learn what it means to break their silence. Ana Rosa's handsome 19-year-old brother Guario H�rnandez is appointed as official spokesperson for the villagers' cause, but when an out-and-out rebellion against the government erupts, he--and everyone else--is endangered. As the bulldozers roll in, Ana Rosa and her family discover how utterly worthless words really are in the face of brute force.</p><p> Lynn Joseph paints a vibrant, colorful landscape of this Caribbean island where love, warmth of community, and abundant natural beauty soften the kind of poverty that makes paper--and sometimes doing what you think is right--a luxury. Ana Rosa's engaging, heartfelt poems--"Merengue Dream," "My Brother's Friend"--begin every chapter, setting the tone of the events to follow, and reinforcing how words shape her life and how her life shapes her words. Young readers will be inspired by Ana Rosa's drive and talent, warmed by vivid stories of her close-knit family, and moved by those who fight for what's right at the greatest possible cost. This lovely, lyrical book dances the merengue, glimmers with sunshine, and sways with island breezes.

Comes leather bound with two ribbons in a gift box. </p></p><p>Revised and edited by well-regarded scholars David Cobb and Derek OlsenTo this beautiful volume which introduced many to Marian devotion, and which gave expression to a more personal devotion not necessarily found in the BCP, new material e.g. Stations of the Resurrection has been added. The Litany of the Saints is updated to include holy figures from Hebrew Scriptures, the saints of Jesus one might call them, namely Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Moses, Miriam, and Aaron; Ruth and Naomi. Saints also included are Ignatius of Antioch, Polycarp, Alban. Perpetua and Felicity. Beloved Anglican Saints now includes the pairs: Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes, Nicholas Ferrar and George Herbert, John Keble and Edward Pusey. The updated "Litany of Intercessions in the Night" puts more responsibility on us and is less judgmental. This newly revised edition represents a devotional treasure. --Dr. Deirdre Good, Academic Dean &amp; Professor of New Testament General Theological Seminary<br><br>Forward Movement has issued a revised edition of Saint Augustine's Prayer Book, a long out-of-print manual of prayers first produced by the Order of the Holy Cross. The new edition is rather splendidly printed, bound in leather, the pages edged in gold. For the moment, this manual of private devotions is the latest in a long succession of primers, the first of which were produced laboriously by hand in the medieval church. These primers were immensely popular. Indeed it is estimated that the first printed editions numbered in the thousands, no unremarkable fact given the limited number of literate lay people in England at the beginning of the sixteenth century. ... Prayers are reproduced as they are found, some in traditional language, others in modern American. Much use is made of the prayer book's noon prayers and compline and its occasional prayers. Perhaps miraculously this creates a compendium of things old and things new which flows together with remarkable harmony. One may hope that Bishop Hilsey's ambition to instruct youth (and the not-so-young) so as "to know first the true honour of God, and to know the honour that belongeth to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to the Holy Saints,"may continue to find contemporary expression by the wide use of this admirable volume. --The Rev.

Chan School of Public Health and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, draws on cutting-edge research to explain what the USDA guidelines have gotten wrong&#x2014;and how you can eat right.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an ever-growing body of evidence supporting the relatively simple principles behind healthy eating. Yet the public seems to be more confused than ever about what to eat. The never-ending promotion of celebrity and other fad diets gets in the way of choosing a diet that is healthy for both you and the planet that we all share.<br> <br>So forget popular diets and food trends. Based on information gleaned from the acclaimed Nurses&#x2019; Health Study and Health Professionals Study, which have tracked the health and eating habits of thousands of women and men for more than thirty years, as well as other groundbreaking nutrition research, this revised and updated edition of <i>Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy </i>provides solid recommendations for eating healthfully and living better and longer.<br> <br>Dr. Willett offers eye-opening new research on choosing foods with the best types of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and the relative importance of various food groups and supplements. He clearly explains why controlling weight, after not smoking, is the single most important factor for a long, healthy life; why eating some types of fat is beneficial, and even necessary, for good health; how to choose wisely between different types carbohydrates; how to pick the right protein &#x201c;packages&#x201d;; and what fruits and vegetables&#x2014;not juices!&#x2014;fight disease. Dr. Willett also translates this essential information into simple, easy-to-follow menu plans and tasty recipes. Revised and updated, this new edition of <i>Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</i> is an important resource for every family.</p><p>Aimed at nothing less than totally restructuring the diets of Americans, <i>Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy</i> may well accomplish its goal. Dr. Walter C. Willett gets off to a roaring start by totally dismantling one of the largest icons in health today: the USDA Food Pyramid that we all learn in elementary school. He blames many of the pyramid's recommendations--6 to 11 servings of carbohydrates, all fats used sparingly--for much of the current wave of obesity. At first this may read differently than any diet book, but Willett also makes a crucial, rarely mentioned point about this icon: "The thing to keep in mind about the USDA Pyramid is that it comes from the Department of Agriculture, the agency responsible for promoting American agriculture, not from the agencies established to monitor and protect our health." It's no wonder that dairy products and American-grown grains such as wheat and corn figure so prominently in the USDA's recommendations.<p> Willett's own simple pyramid has several benefits over the traditional format. His information is up-to-date, and you won't find recommendations that come from special-interest groups. His ideas are nothing radical--if we eat more vegetables and complex carbohydrates (no, potatoes are <i>not</i> complex), emphasize healthy fats, and enjoy small amounts of a tremendous variety of food, we will be healthier. You'll find some surprises as well, such as doubts about the overall benefits of soy (unless you're willing to eat a pound and a half of tofu a day), and that nuts, with their "good" fat content, are a terrific snack. Relying on research rather than anecdotes, this is a solidly written nutritional guide that will show you the real story behind how food is digested, from the glycemic index for carbs to the wisdom of adding a multivitamin to your diet. Willett combines research with matter-of-fact language and a no-nonsense tone that turns academic studies into easily understandable suggestions for living. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH, has led the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for twenty-five years and is Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.

She painted heavy violet makeup on her eyelids, yet she made no effort to conceal an odd crimson mark on her chin. The mark was the shape of an anvil and the subject of wild speculation, but nobody had gotten up the nerve to ask Mrs. Starch about it.<br><br>Marta's eyes flicked miserably toward Nick, then back to the teacher. Nick was fond of Marta, although he wasn't sure if he liked her enough to sacrifice himself to Mrs. Starch, who had begun to pace. She was scanning the class, selecting a victim.<br><br>A droplet of perspiration glided like a spider down Nick's neck. If he worked up the courage to raise his hand, Mrs. Starch would pounce swiftly. Right away she'd see that he had forgotten his biology book, a crime that would be forgiven only if Nick was able to explain and then diagram the Calvin cycle, which was unlikely. Nick was still struggling to figure out the Krebs cycle from Chapter 7.<br><br>"Plants, as we all know, are vital to human existence," said Mrs. Starch, on patrol. "And without the Calvin cycle, plants could not exist. Could not exist_._._."<br><br>Graham was waving his arm and squirming like a puppy. The rest of the class prayed that Mrs. Starch would call on him, but she acted as if he were invisible. Abruptly she spun to a halt at the front of Marta's row.<br><br>Marta sat rigidly in the second desk, behind a brainy girl named Libby who knew all about the Calvin cycle--all about everything--but seldom made a peep.<br><br>"The chart on page 169," Mrs. Starch went on, "makes it all plain as day. It's an excellent illustration, and one that you are likely to encounter on a test. Quite likely_._._."<br><br>Marta lowered her head, a tactical mistake. The movement, slight as it was, caught Mrs. Starch's attention.<br><br>Nick sucked in a breath. His heart raced and his head buzzed, because he knew that it was now or never. Marta seemed to shrink under Mrs. Starch's icy gaze. Nick could see tears forming at the corners of Marta's eyes, and he hated himself for hesitating.<br><br>"Come on, people, snap out of your coma," Mrs. Starch chided, tapping the pencil on Libby's desk. "The Calvin cycle?"<br><br>The only reply was a ripping noise--Marta's trembling elbows, tearing holes in the pages of her book.<br><br>Mrs. Starch frowned. "I was hoping for a sea of hands," she said with a disappointed sigh. "But, once again, it seems I'll have to pick a volunteer. An unwilling volunteer_._._."<br><br>As the teacher pointed her pencil at the top of Marta's head, Nick raised his hand.<br><br>I'm toast, he thought. She's gonna crush me like a bug.<br><br>Lowering his eyes, he braced to hear Mrs. Starch call his name.<br><br>"Oh, Duane?" she sang out.<br><br>Great, Nick thought. She forgot who I am.<br><br>But when he looked up, he saw the teacher aiming her pencil at another kid on the other side of the classroom. The mean old bird had totally faked him out, and Marta, too.<br><br>The other kid's name really was Duane, and Nick had known him since elementary school, when he was two years ahead of Nick and known as Duane the Dweeb. One summer, Duane the Dweeb grew five inches and gained thirty-one pounds, and from then on everybody called him Smoke, because that's what he wanted to be called. Some kids said it was because he was a pyro.<br><br>"So, Duane," Mrs. Starch said sweetly. "Have you finished Chapter 8?"<br>Rumpled and sleepy-looking, Smoke grunted and raised his eyes toward the teacher. Nick couldn't see his expression, but the slump of his shoulders suggested a profound lack of interest.<br><br>"Duane?"<br><br>"I guess I read it, yeah."<br><br>"You guess?" Using a thumb and two fingers, Mrs. Starch spun the yellow pencil into a blur, like a miniature airplane propeller. Under less stressful circumstances it would have been entertaining.<br><br>"I read so much," Smoke said, "I forget which is which."<br><br>Several students struggled to smother giggles.<br><br>Marta reached across the aisle, nudged Nick, and mouthed the words "Thank you."<br><br>Nick felt his face redden.<br><br>"For raising your hand," Marta whispered.<br><br>Nick shrugged. "No big deal," he whispered back.<br><br>Mrs. Starch moved across the classroom and positioned herself beside Smoke's desk. "I see you brought your biology book today," she said. <br><br>"That's progress, Duane."<br><br>"I guess."<br><br>"But you'll find that it's much easier to read when it's not upside down." Mrs. Starch rotated the textbook, using the eraser end of her No. 2 pencil.<br><br>Smoke nodded. "Yeah, that's better."<br><br>He tried to flip open the book, but Mrs. Starch pressed down firmly with the pencil, holding the cover closed.<br><br>"No peeking," she said. "Tell me how the Calvin cycle produces sugar from carbon dioxide, and why that's so important to photosynthesis."<br><br>"Gimme a minute." Smoke casually began to pick at a nasty-looking zit on his meaty, fuzz-_covered neck.<br><br>Mrs. Starch said, "We're all waiting," which was true. The other students, including Nick and Marta, were on the edge of their seats. <br><br>They were aware that something major and possibly legendary was about to occur, though they had no clue that within forty-eight hours they would each be questioned by sheriff's deputies and asked to tell what they'd seen and heard.</p><h2>Deception Point</h2><p>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, <i>Angels &amp; Demons,</i> and <i>Inferno</i>&#x2014;now a major film directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones&#x2014;comes a lightning-fast thriller about an astonishing NASA discovery that uncovers a vicious conspiracy leading all the way to the White House.<br><br>When a new NASA satellite spots evidence of an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory...a victory that has profound implications for US space policy and the impending presidential election. With the Oval Office in the balance, the President dispatches White House Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton to the Milne Ice Shelf to verify the authenticity of the find. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic academic Michael Tolland, Rachel uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery&#x2014;a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy.<br> <br>But before Rachel can contact the President, she and Michael are attacked by a deadly team of assassins controlled by a mysterious power broker who will stop at nothing to hide the truth. Fleeing for their lives in an environment as desolate as it is lethal, their only hope for survival is to find out who is behind this masterful ploy. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all.<br> <br>In his most thrilling novel to date, bestselling author Dan Brown transports readers from the ultrasecret National Reconnaissance Office to the towering ice shelves of the Arctic Circle, and back again to the hallways of power inside the West Wing. Heralded for masterfully intermingling science, history, and politics in his critically acclaimed thriller <i>Angels &amp; Demons,</i> Brown has crafted another novel in which nothing is as it seems&#x2014;and behind every corner is a stunning surprise. <i>Deception Point</i> is pulse-pounding fiction at its best.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, December 2001:</b> In the world of page-turning thrillers, Dan Brown holds a special place in the hearts of many of us. After his first book, <i>Digital Fortress</i>, almost passed me by, he wrote <i>Angels and Demons</i>, which was probably one of the half-dozen most exciting thrillers of last year. It is a pleasure to report that his new book lives up to his reputation as a writer whose research and talent make his stories exciting, believable, and just plain unputdownable. <p> The time is now and President Zachary Herney is facing a very tough reelection. His opponent, Senator Sedgwick Sexton, is a powerful man with powerful friends and a mission: to reduce NASA's spending and move space exploration into the private sector. He has numerous supporters, including many beyond the businesses who will profit from this because of the embarrassment of 1996, when the Clinton administration was informed by NASA that proof existed of life on other planets. That information turned out to be premature, if not incorrect. (This story is true; I repeat, Dan Brown's research is very, very good.) The embattled president is assured that a rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice will prove to have far-reaching implications on America's space program. The find, however, needs to be verified.</p><p> Enter Rachel Sexton, a gister for the National Reconnaissance Office. Gisters reduce complex reports into single-page briefs, and in this case the president needs that confirmation before he broadcasts to the nation, probably ensuring his reelection. It's tricky because Rachel is the daughter of his opponent. Rachel is thrilled to be on the team traveling to the Arctic circle. She is a realist about her father's politics and has little respect for his stand on NASA, but Senator Sexton cannot help but have a problem with her involvement.</p><p> Adventure, romance, murder, skullduggery, and nail-biting tension ensue. By the end of <i>Deception Point</i>, the reader will be much better informed about how our space program works and how our politicians react to new information.

Old Man Fookwire's birds migrate south for the winter, and the squirrels decide to follow. They devise an ingenious plan to fly to a warm and beautiful beach with many new plants to snack on and many new birds to see. Though he would never admit it, Old Man Fookwire misses his furry friends. He joins them down south, paints the local birds, and succumbs to sunburn&#x2014;so the squirrels have to drive his car back home.&nbsp;The award-winning team behind <i>Those Darn Squirrels!</i> and <i>Those Darn Squirrels and the Cat Next Door</i>&nbsp;will delight young readers their parents alike with this hilarious and imaginative third installment.</p><p><b>Adam Rubin</b> is a creative director for a digital advertising agency in New York City and the author of six critically acclaimed picture books, including three Those Darn Squirrels titles.

In their third appearance, grumpy Old Man Fookwire is still painting pictures of his beloved birds and shaking his fist at squirrel shenanigans. But, instead of the baba, yaba, and floogle birds flying south alone, the squirrels tag along to see what all the fuss is about. When he receives a collect call from the squirrels turned beach bums, Fookwire's loneliness gets the better of him and he dusts off the red 1957 convertible he's kept hiding in a shed. After reuniting with his bird friends, sunburning his giant schnoz, and painting to his grumpy heart's content, he and the squirrels road trip it back together. Salmieri's characteristic sketches stretch every scene to humorous proportion, making the most of Rubin's quirky story line and eccentric vocabulary.

Using the 7 principles of reality discipline, this father of five and grandfather of four reveals a practical, action-oriented game plan to<br><br>- get kids to listen to parents<br>- encourage healthy attitudes and two-way communication<br>- turn off temper tantrums, minimize sibling rivalries, and foil finicky eaters<br>- put parents back in the driver's seat<br>- prompt long-lasting, positive behavior and instill values<br>- rear respectful, well-behaved children who become responsible difference makers in the world<br><br>Thought-provoking questions at the end of each chapter and Dr. Leman's real-life examples give readers sure-fire techniques for developing a loving, no-nonsense approach for rearing children. With over a million satisfied customers, parents can't go wrong with this classic, perennial bestseller.</p><p>As the title indicates, <i>Making Children Mind Without Losing Yours</i> is a book with a friendly, lighthearted approach. Author Kevin Leman (<i>The New Birth Order Book</i>) speaks directly from his experiences as a father of five and a practicing psychologist. While you won't find specific studies or statistics here, you will find straightforward, practical suggestions that often get right to the heart of troubling situations.<p> Leman's technique, which he refers to as "reality discipline" is based on a particular passage from the Bible, and his book is liberally sprinkled with his religious beliefs. These references will make this book a particular favorite for some readers; his stance that parents' authority comes directly from God is a fundamental principle of his text, and some parents may prefer a less evangelistic approach. That said, it's hard to disagree with suggestions such as "train yourself to be a good listener" and "give your children direct eye contact." Nearly every suggestion is coupled with a real-life example of the behavior in discussion, making for an easy read, and every chapter ends with questions labeled "to review and apply" as well as a short section of concepts to put into practice. The section dealing with divorce suggests you make a list of the chapter's suggestions you find difficult and create a plan to implement them. Leman assumes that anyone reading this book can find the time to create such plans themselves, and doesn't provide his readers with any step-by-step charts. If you're not up to creating your own action plans, you may prefer a more detailed form of help than this book offers. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>The noted psychologist shows you how to raise responsible, happy children without raising your blood pressure, with proven, easy-to-adopt parenting techniques.</p><h2>New Believer&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>How do you share the next step after salvation?

We lived on the moon.<br> <br>We were some of the first lunar colonists. Along with a handful of other scientists and their children, we lived at Moon Base Alpha, the first human settlement in outer space. When NASA had recruited us, they had made it sound like MBA would be the most exciting, amazing, incredible place in the universe.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>It turned out, living on the moon was far more difficult than anyone had predicted. But as hard as it was for the adults, it was even worse being a kid there. Not only did we have to deal with the same lousy dehydrated food and cramped sleeping spaces and sadistic toilets as the adults, but there were a host of other problems for kids.<br> <br>Like making friends. There were other kids at MBA, but I hadn&#x2019;t been given any choice in selecting them. I was just stuck with them, and the only other boy my age, Roddy Marquez, wasn&#x2019;t much fun to hang out with. You know how, on earth, parents will sometimes drag you to their friends&#x2019; house for the night and ask you to hang with their friends&#x2019; kid, even though they know the two of you don&#x2019;t really get along? Well, imagine that, instead of going over to their friends&#x2019; house for one night, you&#x2019;ve gone over for three years. And you can&#x2019;t leave.<br> <br>That was another problem with being a kid on the moon: You couldn&#x2019;t go outside and play. Ever. Leaving Moon Base Alpha was extremely dangerous. There were a hundred ways you could die on the lunar surface; we had already lost one person out there and nearly lost another. For this reason, NASA forbade children from ever going outdoors, meaning that we were supposed to spend our whole time on the moon inside a building smaller than your standard Motel 6.<br> <br>Despite it being against the rules, I had experienced the dangers of the surface myself. I had been outside on the moon four times: once while walking to MBA from the rocket that had brought me there and three times due to emergencies. I had nearly died on two of those excursions, which was a 50 percent near-death-experience rate. The same as flipping a coin. Not great odds.<br> <br>And yet I still desperately wanted to go back outside again.<br> <br>I was going nuts cooped up inside Moon Base Alpha. So were all the other kids. Even my six-year-old sister, Violet, who was normally as cheerful as an animated cartoon chipmunk, was starting to go stir-crazy. After eight months on the moon, she had watched every episode of her favorite TV show a thousand times and was constantly hounding Mom and Dad to let her go outside and play.<br> <br>To which they&#x2019;d inevitably have to reply, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whyyyyyy nooooooooot?&#x201d; Violet would whine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bored inside. There&#x2019;s nothing to do on the moon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; my parents would tell her. &#x201c;You could play a game. Or read a book. There are thousands of books we could upload.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to ride my bike,&#x201d; Violet would say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your bicycle is back on earth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I want to go out in a lunar rover. Dash got to go out in a lunar rover.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was an emergency. And Dash was almost killed by a meteorite shower.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At least he got to have some excitement. I never get to almost die. I never get to do anything. I hate this stupid base!&#x201d;<br> <br>At this point my parents would get a little flummoxed. Ideally, they should have argued that &#x201c;hate&#x201d; was a strong word and that the base wasn&#x2019;t stupid, but the fact was, neither of them was a big fan of MBA. I think both of them were feeling really guilty about having volunteered our family for service on the moon. Which would also explain why Dad ended up waking me at two a.m. on my birthday to play catch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dash,&#x201d; he whispered, shaking me lightly. &#x201c;I have a surprise for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sat up groggily on my inflatable mattress and promptly bonked my head on the low ceiling of my sleep pod. Even after eight months at MBA, I still hadn&#x2019;t gotten used to the fact that our sleeping areas were as tiny as coffins. I glanced at my watch and groaned. &#x201c;Dad, it&#x2019;s the middle of the night . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . on my birthday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry. It&#x2019;s just that this is the only time I can take you outside without Nina noticing us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Outside?!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d like to try out some extreme low-gravity sports.&#x201d;<br> <br>I blinked at my father in the darkness, trying to figure out if this was a bad joke or a good dream. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s illegal for me to go outside.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I figured we could make an exception for your birthday. What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was out of my sleep pod before he could even finish the sentence, yanking on a T-shirt and shorts over the boxers I&#x2019;d slept in. &#x201c;What about meteors?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They shouldn&#x2019;t be an issue. I&#x2019;ve run a dozen atmospheric scans. No known clouds of potential meteors or space debris are anywhere within two hundred thousand miles. But we&#x2019;ll stay close to base anyhow, just in case.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I knew that, should a meteorite hit me directly, it wouldn&#x2019;t matter how close to base I was; I&#x2019;d be dead. But the risk of that was nonexistent if the skies were clear. Dad wouldn&#x2019;t have taken the chance if he didn&#x2019;t think it was safe. &#x201c;And Nina . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Asleep. She was on the ComLink with earth until two hours ago, but I haven&#x2019;t heard a peep out of her since then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nina Stack was the moon-base commander. She was tough as nails and had the emotional range of a blender. (For this reason, all the kids called her Nina the Machina.) Her quarters were right next to ours, and the walls were thin; if you pressed your ear against one, you could hear everything in the next room. So if Dad said Nina was asleep, she was probably asleep.<br> <br>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t opening the air lock trigger some sort of alert?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Normally, yes. But Chang showed me how to hack the system.&#x201d; Chang Kowalski was my father&#x2019;s closest friend at MBA and the smartest person I had ever met; if anyone knew how to hack the system, it was him.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; Dad urged. &#x201c;Before we wake your sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since he hadn&#x2019;t mentioned Mom, I glanced toward her sleep pod. She was awake, peering out of it, looking a little jealous that Dad was getting to go with me, rather than her. &#x201c;Happy birthday,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Have fun out there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave me a bittersweet smile. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe I have a teenager. I&#x2019;m old.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look old,&#x201d; Dad told her. &#x201c;You look the same as the day I met you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s just the low gravity. Wait until you see me back on earth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll look even better there, I promise.&#x201d; Dad gave Mom a kiss (which I averted my eyes from), then grabbed our baseball and led me out the door.<br> <br>It took another fifteen minutes for us to get outside. Space suits are difficult to put on, and you don&#x2019;t want to make a mistake. Otherwise you could freeze to death. Or suffocate as your oxygen leaks out. Or both. All of which were things we obviously wanted to avoid. So Dad and I took great care suiting up, then double-, triple-, and quadruple-checked each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the suit feel?&#x201d; Dad asked me. With our helmets on, we were now using radios to communicate, even though we were standing right next to each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, I guess,&#x201d; I reported. &#x201c;Seems a little tighter in the shoulders than it was last time I went out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Dad asked, surprised. And then understanding flooded his face. &#x201c;Oh my gosh,&#x201d; he sighed. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve grown.&#x201d;<br> <br>I would have smacked my forehead if I hadn&#x2019;t been wearing a space helmet. Over the past few weeks, I&#x2019;d begun a growth spurt. It was only an inch so far, but still, that had very different repercussions on the moon than on earth. The few T-shirts I had brought were getting tighter and shorter on me, so we&#x2019;d had to ask NASA to send new ones on the next supply rocket. The same applied to the single pair of sneakers I had brought; in the meantime, I&#x2019;d had to slit the tips off with a paring knife to make room for my toes. And as for my space suit . . .<br> <br>Everyone on the moon had a suit specifically designed for them and no one else. Many parts of mine, like my helmet, had been sculpted specifically to my own personal measurements, meaning that someone significantly bigger or smaller than me wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use it. However, it appeared that NASA&#x2014;which had only made space suits for adults until recently&#x2014;had forgotten something very important about kids: We grew. And in the significantly lower gravity of the moon, there was a chance we might grow even faster than we did on earth. Meaning that, after being on the moon for three years, our suits might not fit us anymore.<br> <br>Of course, I hadn&#x2019;t thought about this myself, and apparently no one else had either until that moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think it&#x2019;s still safe for me to wear it?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Dad said reassuringly. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t grown that much. But I wonder if your sister&#x2019;s still fits her. She&#x2019;s sprouted a bit since we got here, and she hasn&#x2019;t tried her suit on in eight months. She ought to, though. And all the other kids should too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Especially Roddy,&#x201d; I said, meaning Rodrigo Marquez, the only other boy on base my age. The one I was stuck on the moon with. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s any taller, but he&#x2019;s definitely rounder than when we got here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Roddy was the only person who had actually gained weight at MBA. He was one of the few Moonies who actually found space food appetizing and he had staunchly avoided the two hours of exercise a day we were required to do to combat low-gravity bone and muscle loss. There was a decent chance that, once we got back to earth and its stronger gravity, Roddy wouldn&#x2019;t have the strength to stand up.<br> <br>Dad didn&#x2019;t say anything in response, though. A cloud of worry had formed over his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; He turned back to me, then seemed to snap back to the present. He gave me a smile, but I could tell it was forced. &#x201c;No, I was just thinking about the suits. Remind me to make sure we test your sister&#x2019;s on her, first thing tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;First thing?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not leaving here for another two and a half years. If we&#x2019;re lucky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Still, there could always be an emergency and we might have to evacuate.&#x201d; While that was true, I got the sense something else was on my father&#x2019;s mind. Before I could press the issue, though, he said, &#x201c;Looks like we&#x2019;re good to go. Let&#x2019;s get out there before someone comes along and sees us.&#x201d;<br> <br>With that, he picked up the baseball, opened the interior door of the air lock and stepped inside. I followed him.<br> <br>I was quivering with excitement.<br> <br>I had expected to be more nervous after my previous life-threatening trips onto the surface, but those had been very different. Each of those times, I had been in a rush, and lives had been on the line. This time I was going outside simply to have fun. And my father was with me, which made a big difference.<br> <br>Honestly, the whole point of going to the moon is to walk around on the surface. For as long as people have dreamed of going there, the dreams have never been about being cooped up in a moon base. The dreams have been about making boot prints in moon dust that will last forever, climbing mountains that no human has ever climbed, and staring up into the sky and seeing our home planet in the distance. All anyone remembers about humanity&#x2019;s first visit to the moon is the two and a half hours Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent on the surface, not the additional nineteen hours they spent in the lunar module.<br> <br>The air-lock chamber depressurized, and then a green light lit up by the outer door, indicating that it was okay to head outside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sun&#x2019;s out,&#x201d; Dad said. &#x201c;Lower your visor.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was already doing it. The moon doesn&#x2019;t have an atmosphere, so in the direct sunlight it&#x2019;s more than four hundred degrees. Without the protective mirrored visors in our helmets, our heads would have cooked like microwave popcorn.<br> <br>Dad lowered his visor too. His face disappeared and was replaced with a warped mirror that reflected me back at myself.<br> <br>Then Dad opened the exterior air-lock door and we bounded out onto the moon.<br> <br>Since the sun was out, the entire plain of moon dust before us was lit up. Above us, the sky was pitch black, save for earth, hanging in the air by the horizon. I stopped and stared at it for a few seconds, thinking how beautiful it was&#x2014;and wishing I was back there.<br> <br>Dad seemed to sense this&#x2014;he was probably thinking the same thing&#x2014;and so he made a blatant attempt to distract me. He bonked me on my helmet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I said, wheeling around toward him.<br> <br>He held up the baseball and said, &#x201c;Go long.&#x201d;<br> <br>So I did. I bounded across the lunar surface. It wasn&#x2019;t easy, as the moon dust was thick and slightly adhesive, and the weight of my space suit counteracted the low lunar gravity. But it was still a joy to be playing outside at all.<br> <br>The last time I had played catch with my father had been more than eight months before. It had been our last trip back home to Hawaii before setting off for the moon. We had returned from training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston to say good-bye to family and friends, to take a few last hikes in the mountains, to surf a few last waves. It had been a bittersweet visit, knowing that we wouldn&#x2019;t get to do anything like that again for three years, but at the time we&#x2019;d all been very excited about heading to the moon. We were blissfully unaware of how much worse life would be at MBA than NASA had prepared us for.<br> <br>In the last eight months, I had been able to play ball inside MBA, but it wasn&#x2019;t the same as doing it outdoors. And every time I did it, Nina inevitably showed up and ordered me to stop it before I hurt someone or broke something. This also happened whenever I and the other kids tried to do anything physical, like tag or hide-and-seek or blindman&#x2019;s bluff. Officially, the only place approved for strenuous activity at MBA was the gymnasium, but the gym was too small to play in. Yet another reason why being a kid on the moon was lame.<br> <br>Technically, we weren&#x2019;t even supposed to bring balls to the moon because of the potential for injury, but Dad had found a loophole. We were all allowed to bring a few special &#x201c;personal effects&#x201d; to remind us of home, so Dad had faked the signature of Sandy Koufax on the ball and claimed it was a family heirloom.<br> <br>I got forty yards across the moon and spun back to face my father.<br> <br>He tossed the ball my way. Only in the low gravity, he didn&#x2019;t know his own strength. It rocketed out of his hand and sailed several stories over my head. &#x201c;Oh, crap!&#x201d; he exclaimed.<br> <br>I spun around and ran for the ball again. Thankfully, it wasn&#x2019;t hard to track. Against the pitch-black sky, it glowed like an oncoming headlight....</p><h2>I Spy Little Animals: A Book of Picture Riddles</h2><p><b>Search-and-find riddles paired with amazing photographs will captivate kids of all ages in the bestselling <i>I Spy</i> series.</b><br><br>Filled with fun photos from the original <i>I Spy</i> series, the <i>I Spy</i> little board books build reading and recognition skills.<br><br>Preschoolers can search for animals galore, as well as other intriguing toys and trinkets!

(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p><h2>In the Lake of the Woods</h2><p>This riveting novel of love and mystery from the author of <i>The Things They Carried</i> examines the lasting impact of the twentieth century&#x2019;s legacy of violence and warfare, both at home and abroad. When long-hidden secrets about the atrocities he committed in Vietnam come to light, a candidate for the U.S. Senate retreats with his wife to a lakeside cabin in northern Minnesota. Within days of their arrival, his wife mysteriously vanishes into the watery wilderness.</p><p>Tim O'Brien has been writing about Vietnam in one way or another ever since he served there as an infantryman in the late 1960s. His earliest work on the subject, <i>If I Die in a Combat Zone</i>, was an intensely personal memoir of his own tour of duty; his books since then have featured many of the same elements of fear, boredom, and moral ambiguity but in a fictional setting. In 1994 O'Brien wrote <i>In the Lake of the Woods</i>, a novel that, while imbued with the troubled spirit of Vietnam, takes place entirely after the war and in the United States. The main character, John Wade, is a man in crisis: after spending years building a successful political career, he finds his future derailed during a bid for the U.S. Senate by revelations about his past as a soldier in Vietnam. The election lost by a landslide, John and his wife, Kathy, retreat to a small cabin on the shores of a Minnesota lake--from which Kathy mysteriously disappears. <p> Was she murdered? Did she run away? Instead of answering these questions, O'Brien raises even more as he slowly reveals past lives and long-hidden secrets. Included in this third-person narrative are "interviews" with the couple's friends and family as well as footnoted excerpts from a mix of fictionalized newspaper reports on the case and real reports pertaining to historical events--a m�lange that lends the novel an eerie sense of verisimilitude. If Kathy's disappearance is at the heart of this work, then John's involvement in a My Lai-type massacre in Vietnam is its core, and O'Brien uses it to demonstrate how wars don't necessarily end when governments say they do. <i>In the Lake of the Woods</i> may not <i>be</i> true, but it <i>feels</i> true--and for Tim O'Brien, that's true enough. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>TIM O&#x2019;BRIEN received the 1979 National Book Award for <i>Going After Cacciato</i>.

By focusing on what it takes to get there, and not on getting there, our LSU team was able to win the BCS national title. All along the way, we as coaches imparted ideas, philosophies, and practices that helped shape the team. The story of our championship is exciting, but just as important are the lessons we learned and taught along the way. To make sure these stand out, I&#x2019;ve highlighted them for you.<br><br>Most people think that the Louisiana State University football team won the national championship on the night of January 4, 2004, at the Nokia Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. They believe that because we were the better team that night against Oklahoma&#x2014;because we had better players making bigger plays and coaches making better moves&#x2014;we won the championship. But I tend to disagree. I think we actually won the national title almost four hundred days earlier in Little Rock, Arkansas.<br><br>After we captured the Southeastern Conference (SEC) championship in 2001, expectations were obviously quite high in Baton Rouge for our 2002 squad. We were led by strong seniors, including Bradie James, and gifted underclassmen, including quarterbacks Matt Mauck and Marcus Randall and receivers Michael Clayton and Devery Henderson. We certainly were going to miss the seniors&#x2019; abilities and leadership, but I thought we had a solid team, particularly on defense. I&#x2019;ve been coaching the game long enough to know that, as defending SEC champions, we had a big red target on our back. We knew that every SEC game would be a war. And, boy, were we right.<br><br>Ranked #14 in the nation, we started off the season against #16 Virginia Tech in a nationally televised game in Blacksburg, in front of sixty-five thousand screaming fans. It was a difficult environment to play in, and we did nothing to help our cause. With eight first-time starters in the game, our inexperience showed early and often. Fumbles, interceptions, blocked punts, and penalties gave us little chance, and we trailed 24&#x2013;0 before scoring in the fourth quarter. It was not a great start to the season. But we rebounded and defeated The Citadel and Miami of Ohio at home before winning our SEC opener against Mississippi State, 31&#x2013;13. Our confidence was high and, after routing University of Louisiana&#x2014;Lafayette the following week and dominating Florida 36&#x2013;7 at Gainesville, we were a team to be reckoned with. Except for one thing. We had lost starting quarterback Matt Mauck to a broken foot in the Florida game. We managed to keep the winning streak going with a win over South Carolina. We were 6&#x2013;1, atop the SEC and ranked #10 in the nation. But then we headed to Auburn.<br><br>We fumbled on our first play from scrimmage, and it didn&#x2019;t get much better from there. We turned the ball over five times and lost 31&#x2013;7. The following week against Kentucky, we won only by virtue of the &#x201c;Bluegrass Miracle,&#x201d; when Marcus Randall connected on a 75-yard Hail Mary to Devery Henderson on the last play of the game. Truth told, we probably should not have won. Alabama made sure there was no miracle the next week, soundly trouncing us at home, 31&#x2013;0. After a fourth-quarter comeback against Ole Miss the following week, we were in a position to win the SEC West again and make a return trip to the SEC title game&#x2014;if we could get past Arkansas in the season finale. With forty seconds left in the game, we led 20&#x2013;14. The game was ours if we could simply stop Arkansas from a full-field drive. We couldn&#x2019;t. Arkansas quarterback Matt Jones threw the ball over the top of our prevent defense to Richard Smith for a 50-yard gain. A few plays later, he connected with receiver DeCori Birmingham on a 30-yard touchdown pass with nine seconds left. The extra point was good, and the wind was officially kicked out of us.<br><br>In my opinion, that&#x2019;s when we began our march toward the national championship.<br><br>After the crushing loss to Arkansas, we all rededicated ourselves to the little things. The awful feeling of that last-second loss had an indelible impact on everyone in the LSU program. Never again would we squander a lead; never again would we be outplayed in the fourth quarter; never again would we be outworked any day of the year. It was then that the championship team was born.<br><br>Immediately after the Cotton Bowl loss to Texas, the coaches hit the road&#x2014;recruiting like never before&#x2014;and the players hit the weight room. They voluntarily worked out almost every day, often in large groups, well before the official off-season conditioning began. In February, in the first official team meeting before off-season conditioning began, I asked everyone in the room&#x2014;players, coaches, managers&#x2014;to close their eyes and think about how they&#x2019;d felt just months earlier, in the moments after the Arkansas loss. I didn&#x2019;t want them to forget it. When team workouts began in earnest, there was a renewed optimism and a clear sense of commitment on the part of the players. They arrived early for workouts and stayed late. They encouraged one another and kept each other in line. In the winter of 2003, we enjoyed the highest attendance rate of any off-season. The work ethic and positive attitude apparent in the strength and conditioning workouts continued into the spring, and the spring practices were more impressive than I could have hoped. Every single man played as if each down was his last. There was no letup.<br><br>In the late spring, the seniors on the team gathered to set out the goals for the 2003 LSU program. We had no outspoken or easily identifiable leader on our team&#x2014;there were even some worries that there was an absence of the kind of strong, recognizable leader we&#x2019;d had in the past. Our concerns about a vacuum of leadership vanished when the seniors presented me with the team goals.<br><br>1.&nbsp;Be a Team&#x2014;Together Everyone Accomplishes More.<br><br>2.&nbsp;Work to Dominate Your Opponent.<br><br>3.&nbsp;Positively Affect Our Teammates.<br><br>4.&nbsp;Individual Responsibility for Self-Determination.<br><br>5.&nbsp;Be Champions On and Off the Field.<br><br>None of the five goals says anything about how many games we wanted to win or what titles we were striving for. No, these goals were about performance&#x2014;on and off the field&#x2014;and they set the tone for the 2003 season. We did indeed have some true leaders&#x2014;and we were proud of them.<br><br>Come summertime, we had more players pass our summer conditioning tests than ever before. The players hung out together away from the field and stayed out of trouble. They attended summer school classes, did their work, and got along great. The older guys welcomed the newcomers with open arms. When camp began in August, everyone involved&#x2014;coaches, players, managers, and trainers&#x2014;was as focused as in any program I&#x2019;ve been a part of. There was simply no selfishness on this team. The upperclassmen helped teach the freshmen, competitors for starting positions respected one another, and both sides of the ball took pride in their effort. Players didn&#x2019;t complain of the heat, and the coaches didn&#x2019;t talk about the long hours. We shared a purpose; we all knew what we wanted to accomplish. And there was some additional inspiration. Our longtime equipment manager and friend, Jeff Boss, had been suffering from cancer, and his condition was not good. It affected all of us.<br><br>As a coach, you are often more optimistic than realistic before the first kickoff, but we had a lot of faith in the personality of this team. Still, to be successful, you also have to be lucky. Could we stay injury-free this year? Would we avoid the off-the-field pitfalls that can break a team apart? Would we get some lucky bounces and make the big plays when we had to? You see, it&#x2019;s not just about having the best players&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about being relentless in the pursuit of your goal and resilient in the face of bad luck and adversity.<br><br>On offense, we had Matt Mauck at quarterback, backed up by an equally experienced Marcus Randall. Matt was intelligent and mature and athletic, and though he wasn&#x2019;t the greatest natural passer on the field, he commanded respect and the team felt comfortable with him at the helm. In the backfield, there was a plethora of backs, from Shyrone Carey to Joseph Addai to a trio of outstanding newcomers. On the offensive line, All-Everything guard Stephen Peterman and tackle Andrew Whitworth were joined by center Ben Wilkerson and tackle Rodney Reed. It was the most experienced group we&#x2019;d ever had. The receiving corps was one of the best in the country, with Michael Clayton, Skyler Green, and Devery Henderson leading the way. So our offense was strong and armed with a number of weapons.<br><br>Then there was the defense. The 2003 LSU defense looked like the finest I have ever had the privilege of coaching. The defensive line included senior Chad Lavalais and junior ends Marquise Hill and Marcus Spears. Lionel Turner led the linebackers, and the secondary was phenomenal, with safety Jack Hunt, corners Corey Webster and Travis Daniels, nickel back Randall Gay, and freshman LaRon Landry vying for playing time. We moved Eric Alexander from safety to linebacker, and he did not disappoint.<br><br>We opened the season, as I noted, ranked #14 in the country, but that didn&#x2019;t matter to us. The players and coaches were focused on the daily practices and game planning, not who was on our schedule, where we were ranked, or who on the team was going to the NFL after the season. To the team&#x2019;s credit, the focus on the process of being champions never wavered. And our opening game was a pretty good sign.<br><br>The offense amassed 474 yards and 23 first downs, and the defense allowed just one score in a 49&#x2013;7 win over the University of Louisiana&#x2014;Monroe. A week later, on September 6, we traveled to the Far West and took on Arizona on their turf. At the end of the first quarter, we led 17&#x2013;0. At the half, 38&#x2013;0. After the third quarter, 45&#x2013;0, and the final score was 59&#x2013;13. It was not perfect, as we fumbled four times, but Matt and Marcus looked solid behind center. We had one more nonconference game to go before opening up SEC play. Again, we didn&#x2019;t play great against Western Illinois, losing three fumbles and suffering poor special teams, but we played well enough to move to 3&#x2013;0 with a 35&#x2013;7 win.<br><br>We try to never look at the schedule or think about it in terms of nonconference, conference, and postseason games, but, clearly, the SEC games raise the stakes. We want our players to treat Western Illinois the same way they would approach Georgia or Auburn or Florida. After all, the opponent should never determine your level of competitive spirit. Still, I can tell you we were very excited on September 20 to welcome Georgia to Baton Rouge.<br><br>As I&#x2019;ve said, one thing about championship teams is that they&#x2019;re resilient. No matter what is thrown at them, no matter how deep the hole, they find a way to bounce back and overcome adversity. And, for us, no game throughout the entire 2003 season was more emblematic of that than our game against Georgia.<br><br>The Bulldogs scored first on a Billy Bennett field goal in the first quarter to go ahead 3&#x2013;0. On our next series, quarterback Matt Mauck dropped back to pass and was intercepted. Not only were we trailing, but we&#x2019;d just given Georgia a gift. But we bounced back. A few plays after Matt&#x2019;s interception throw, Georgia quarterback David Greene fumbled the ball on our 8-yard line. We had escaped. On their next offensive possession, Billy Bennett&#x2019;s field goal was nullified by offsetting penalties, and his second attempt was no good. Again, we had dodged a bullet. He missed another field goal attempt in the second quarter. Our defense was giving up good field position, but our offense was moving the sticks consistently to get that field position back.<br><br>We finally got on the board late in the first half when Matt connected on a 31-yard pass play to receiver Skyler Green and running back Shyrone Carey scored on a 21-yard run with 3:10 left before halftime, giving us a 7&#x2013;3 lead. Unbelievably, Billy Bennett missed a third field goal attempt late in the half. After all that we had done wrong&#x2014;the interception, the poor defense, the stagnant offense&#x2014;we still led a very good Georgia team at the half.<br><br>We opened the scoring in the second half when Ryan Gaudet kicked a field goal to put us ahead 10&#x2013;3 and linebacker Lionel Turner picked off David Greene shortly thereafter. We had the ball and the momentum. But football is a crazy game and, just like that, we lost both the ball and momentum when Ryan&#x2019;s 31-yard field goal attempt was blocked. The adversity continued when we got the ball back and Matt fumbled inside the 25-yard line. I couldn&#x2019;t believe what I was seeing. This wasn&#x2019;t the team that had dominated the first three games of the season. On second and 13 from his own 7-yard line, David Greene threw a screen pass to Tyson Browning, who did the rest&#x2014;running 93 yards for a touchdown to tie the game at 10&#x2013;10 with just 4:25 left.<br><br>To me, that was the defining moment of our season. We had just allowed a huge play late in a big game after a critical turnover. How would we respond? No one blinked&#x2014;not the coaches, not the players, not the crowd.<br><br>Devery Henderson returned the ensuing kickoff 52 yards, then Matt hit Skyler for a 34-yard touchdown with 3:03 left to give us a 17&#x2013;10 lead, which we did not relinquish. We won the heavyweight battle not by dominating, but by exhibiting sheer determination and resiliency. The tendency is to think that we won because they missed three field goals, dropped some passes, and so forth; but it was our resiliency that allowed us to overcome our own errors and mistakes. There was relief in the postgame locker room, but I also noticed a determination on the faces of the players. They weren&#x2019;t satisfied with the win&#x2014;they knew they hadn&#x2019;t played to their potential and they knew that it was just one game. I liked that attitude.<br><br>The following week against Mississippi State, we played much better on both sides of the ball in a convincing 41&#x2013;6 win, which was tougher than the score indicated. With the 5&#x2013;0 start, LSU had its best start to a season since 1973. We were on a roll as we prepared to take on rival Florida at home.</p><h2>The Little Red Hen (Folk Tale Classics) (Paul Galdone Nursery Classic)</h2><p><i></i><p><i>Little Red Hen</i> is a time-tested cautionary tale about how we reap what we sow.

You know it. You feel it. You hide it. You fear it. You have been touched by an epidemic. It deprives children of their future, the elderly of their past, and adults of their present. </p><p> No one is talking about this invisible epidemic. Yet it's the leading cause of disability, affects 1.1 billion people worldwide -- one in six children, one in two elderly -- and will cripple one in four people during their lifetime. </p><p> I am talking about the epidemic of broken brains. </p><p> We refer to our "broken brains" by many names -- depression, anxiety, memory loss, brain fog, attention deficit disorder or ADD, autism, and dementia to name a few. </p><p> This epidemic of brain breakdown shows up in radically different ways from person to person so that they all seem like separate problems. But the truth is that they are all manifestations of a few common underlying root causes. </p><p> These seemingly different disorders are <i>all</i> really the same problem -- imbalances in the seven keys to UltraWellness. </p><p> Conventional treatments don't help, make things worse, or provide only slight benefit. </p><p> That's because conventional treatments use the wrong model to heal these disorders. </p><p> There is another way to fix your broken brain, and it is not what you have heard or might think. </p><p> Just as brain problems all stem from the same root causes, they all have the same solution -- <i>The UltraMind Solution.</i> </p><p> I know this as both doctor and patient. My own brain broke one beautiful late August day in 1996. I became disoriented and terrified and descended into a spiral of helplessness and hopelessness. </p><p> Let me tell you my story. </p><p> <b>My Broken Brain</b> </p><p> <i>Learning, thinking, and speaking were always easy for me. My brain never failed me. In college, I learned thousands of Chinese characters. In medical school, the intricate patterns and names of our anatomy -- the bones, muscles, organs, vessels, and nerves -- mapped effortlessly into my mind, and the complex pathways of physiology and biochemistry were clear after one lecture and reading my notes. </i></p><p><i> I ran four miles every day to medical school. I took detailed notes in my classes, able to simultaneously listen to, remember, and write down nearly every word my professors spoke. </i></p><p><i> At the end of the day I ran back again to my apartment, did yoga for an hour, ate a freshly prepared whole-foods meal, and studied without distraction or loss of focus for three hours every night. Then I crawled into bed, fell peacefully asleep within five minutes, and slept deeply for seven hours. </i></p><p><i> The next day I got up and did it all over again. </i></p><p><i> That rhythmic life broke down, as it does for all physicians in training, when I entered the hospital and started pushing my body and mind beyond their limits with regular thirty-six-hour shifts on top of an occasional sixty-hour shift (Friday morning to Monday evening!). </i></p><p><i> When I went to practice as a small-town family doctor in Idaho, I worked a shortened schedule of only eighty hours a week, seeing thirty patients a day, delivering babies, and working in the emergency room. </i></p><p><i> From Idaho, I went to work in China for a year, breathing in the coal-soaked, mercury-laden air, before I landed back in Massachusetts, working a crazy schedule of shifts in an inner-city emergency room. </i></p><p><i> Then suddenly (or so it appeared at the time), my brain broke -- along the with rest of my body. </i></p><p><i> Sitting with patients, I often couldn't remember what they had just said, or where I was in eliciting their story. I tried to take careful notes and keep track, but I couldn't focus on conversations, couldn't remember anyone's name. I started taking pictures and writing down personal details about my patients to serve as my peripheral memory so I wouldn't embarrass myself the next time I spoke to them. </i></p><p><i> During lectures I had to give as part of my job, I would get lost in the middle of a sentence and had to ask the audience what I had just said. When I read a book, I had to go over passages again and again just to glean any meaning. At night, I read my children bedtime stories but had to robotically mouth the words, because I couldn't simultaneously read aloud and understand what I read. </i></p><p><i> Sleep eluded me. Exhausted and bone weary, I would lie down in bed at night and remain sleepless for hours. After finally drifting off, I would wake the next morning feeling as if I had never slept. </i></p><p><i> Depression and anxiety, which I had never known before, became constant companions. </i></p><p><i> At times I felt I couldn't go on any longer. My capacity for pleasure and laughter faded into a distant memory. </i></p><p><i> The worse my body felt, the worse my brain functioned. If my stomach was bloated and swollen and I had diarrhea, I couldn't think or sleep. If my tongue was inflamed or my eyes swollen and red, I became depressed. If my muscles ached and twitched, I couldn't focus. If I felt bone-weary fatigue, I would forget what I was saying or why I had just walked into a room. </i></p><p><i> Some doctors said I was depressed and recommended antidepressants. Psychiatrists suggested antianxiety drugs. My family doctor prescribed sleeping medication. A neurologist told me I had ADD and I needed stimulants. Others said I had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. All I knew was that my brain was broken, my focus gone, my mood depressed, my memory fleeting, and my body wasn't working. </i></p><p><i> All at once, I couldn't pay attention, remember, or experience joy and happiness. It was as if I had suddenly "contracted" three terrible diseases -- attention deficit disorder, depression, and dementia. How could my brain have failed me? The part of me that was strongest suddenly became my weakest link. What had happened? </i></p><p><i> What I experienced was extreme and I hid it from the rest of the world, except for a very few close friends. I faked it and pulled myself through each day. </i></p><p><i> But after that summer day in August when my brain broke, weary and fighting brain fog, I began searching for answers. </i></p><p><i> Piece by piece, cell by cell, body system by body system, I discovered the source of my broken brain. By combing through the literature, consulting with dozens of scientists and doctors, and experimenting with my body and mind, I slowly put myself back together. </i></p><p><i> It wasn't one thing that broke my brain. It was everything piled higher and higher until my brain and body couldn't take anymore. It seemed sudden but was the end of a long series of exposures to toxins, stress, and a strange infection. </i></p><p><i> The trail led back to mercury poisoning from living in Beijing, China, breathing in raw coal used to heat homes for 10 million people, eating endless childhood tuna-fish sandwiches, and having a mouthful of "silver" or mercury fillings. I was also missing a key gene needed to detoxify all this mercury, which compounded the problem. I found out about this later through careful testing. </i></p><p><i> Years of sleepless nights delivering babies and working in the emergency room </i></p><p><i> destroyed my body's rhythms, which I tried to bolster with quadruple espressos, giant-size chocolate chip cookies, and mountains of Chunky Monkey ice cream (I reasoned that was healthy because of the bananas and walnuts!). </i></p><p><i> Then one late summer day in 1996 I ate or drank something up in a wilderness camp in Maine that infected my gut. That was the straw that broke the camel's back.</i> </p><p> </p><p> This book is the story of my healing. It is also the story of the discoveries I made that hold the answer to our current epidemic of broken brains. It offers a solution to your suffering just as it did to mine. </p><p> How many of you feel what I felt, at least to some degree? </p><p> </p><blockquote> � Maybe you fear losing your job because you're tired, unfocused, inattentive, and your memory is failing so you can't properly perform your tasks at work. <p> � Do you feel depressed, hopeless, disconnected, and disengaged from your life? </p><p> � Do you see your relationships breaking down because you are mentally and emotionally absent or numb? </p><p> � Perhaps you struggle to focus so you can help your children with their homework and guide them through life, but feel sure you aren't living up to your duties as a parent. </p><p> � Do you lie awake at night, tormented by the grief and pain of living half a life, and then worry about how you will find a way to wake up early in the morning just so you can get your kids to school? </p><p> � Do you forget to meet friends or go to appointments, and then can't figure out how in the world you forgot? </p></blockquote> <p> If so, you aren't alone. You have been affected by the broken brain epidemic, a terrifying and life-threatening chronic illness that has been largely unaddressed by the medical community, leaving millions of people to suffer alone, trapped in their deteriorating minds. </p><p> <b>Our Looming Silent Epidemic of Broken Brains</b> </p><p> Obesity is obvious. You can't hide it. But mental illness and memory loss are suffered silently, hidden from view. Yet they touch nearly everyone either directly or indirectly; personally or through family members and friends. </p><p> Our broken brains cause many problems -- anxiety, depression, bipolar disease, personality disorders, eating disorders, addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, autism, Asperger's, learning difficulties, and dyslexia. </p><p> Broken brains take many shapes, including psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and mania, as well as all the neurodegenerative diseases of aging, especially Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. </p><p> In addition, there are brain dysfunctions that fall on the lighter side of </p><p> the broken brain continuum.

No way. As hard as Mom tries, Madeleine and her canine babysitter extraordinaire are hot on her trail, tasting the party punch, peeking at presents, and adding some of their own favorite decorations.</p></p><p><b>Alexandra Day</b> is the author and illustrator of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl's Christmas</i>, <i>Carl's Birthday</i> and <i>Carl's Snowy Afternoon</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the original model for the main character of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients.Ages 2^-7. Beloved from many previous escapades, Carl, the gentle rottweiler, and Madeline, the mischievous toddler, are sent to nap at the neighbors' while Mom prepares for the surprise birthday party. But the two buddies sneak back home through Carl's doggie door and watch undetected as Mom tidies and decorates the house. Of course, Carl and Madeline must add their own touches to the preparations, flavoring the punch, hiding and even undoing the carefully wrapped presents, and sampling the beautiful birthday cake, though Carl thoughtfully camouflages the gouge Madeline's hand makes in the frosting. As the guests arrive, Carl, with Madeline riding him bareback, gallops back to the neighbors' house, where the pair are found stretched out side by side, feigning sleep. Characteristically, Day uses brief text only at the beginning and at the end of the story, allowing her luxuriantly colored, expressively detailed paintings to convey the humor and joyful companionship of Carl and Madeline's latest adventure. <i>Ellen Mandel</i></p><h2>Melanin: What Makes Black People Black</h2><p>The Black race s under-education, dys-education (dysfunctional) and mis-education about Melanin merely reflects one particle of a mis-education.

It introduces programming without requiring a computer at all. The point of the book isn&#x2019;t to teach you a programming language, but programming concepts." --GeekMom.com</p><p>Meet Ruby&#x2015;a small girl with a huge imagination, and the determination to solve any puzzle. As Ruby stomps around her world making new friends, including the Wise Snow Leopard, the Friendly Foxes, and the Messy Robots, kids will be introduced to the fundamentals of computational thinking, like how to break big problems into small ones, create step-by-step plans, look for patterns and think outside the box through storytelling. Then, these basic concepts at the core of coding and programming will be reinforced through fun playful exercises and activities that encourage exploration and creativity. </p><p>In Ruby's world anything is possible if you put your mind to it.</p></p><p><b>Linda Liukas</b> is a programmer, storyteller, and illustrator from Helsinki, Finland. She is a central figure in the world of programming and worked on edutech before it was even called that. Linda is the founder of Rails Girls, a global phenomenon teaching the basics of programming to young women all over the world. She was selected as the 2013 Ruby Hero (the most notable prize within the Ruby programming community) and she is the Digital Champion of Finland, appointed by EU commissioner Neelie Kroes.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Bubbly redhead Ruby takes readers on a journey through an imaginary world replete with talking penguins, snow leopards, robots, and foxes who unwittingly teach her basic coding concepts. When Ruby's father travels out of town, he leaves her with a challenge: to find five gems. Armed with four scraps of paper, she uses her analytic skills to draw a map of the imaginary world where the gems are hidden, and children follow Ruby as she looks for them. The hunt for each gem involves a loose tie-in to a host of coding concepts, such as sequencing, patterns, loops, and pattern recognition. Notably, though, none of these terms are used in the actual text of the story; instead they are discussed at length in the post-story "Activity Book" section. Colorful and cheerful illustrations offer enticing Easter egg clues to observant readers throughout are in both the story and the "Activity Book." The visuals also serve to pick up the slack left by the somewhat didactic text. The "Activity Book" furthers the learning of conceptual coding ideas but requires patience and concentration that the intended audience may not yet possess. Kids will not necessarily walk away knowing how to write code but may possibly grasp some of the basic concepts. VERDICT This whimsical coding story could be a great resource for mathematical-minded youngsters but might soar over the heads of those less math-inclined.&#x2014;Amy M.

Dick Eastman challenges Christians to spend one hour each day in prayer, and he outlines a twelve-step prayer program to help them accomplish the task. <br> By dividing one hour into twelve five-minute "points of focus," such as praise, waiting, confession, and Scripture praying, believers will develop a more consistent habit of daily prayer. The Hour That Changes the World draws heavily on Scripture and classic devotional writers and includes an appendix titled "Scriptural Intercession."<br> This 25th anniversary edition features a new introduction by Eastman and a new foreword by Joni Eareckson Tada, in which she writes: "The Hour That Changes the World may appear small and modest, but don't let its size fool you. Full of biblical insights about prayer, packed with testimonies of prayer warriors from years past, brimming with practical suggestions that will help you carve out a purposeful time of praise and intercession, Dick Eastman's book is arguably the most significant book on prayer written in modern times."</p><p>A classic book with a 21st century challenge.<br><br>More than two million Christians around the world have revitalized their prayer lives through the step-by-step plan of prayer outlined in this book.

As Joni Eareckson Tada writes in the foreword, "Through these pages the Lord Jesus catapulted me into a whole new dimension of joy. . . .

This was a special teaching describing the secret wisdom about the nature of the universe and of the soul as well as a path to make the journey, through varied phases of spiritual evolution, from mortal to immortal and from earth to heaven and beyond. The goal is to regain one�eTMs divine stature and transcendental place. In its earliest form, originated in Ancient Egypt, it was related to theurgical religious system developed in the priests and priestesses of the Ancient Egyptian city of Anu and the Tree was seen as the source of life. This book explains that teaching, which has been available to all, but missed by those who did not possess the keys to unlock its mystic formula. In this volume the Creation teaching of Anu, the TREE OF LIFE metaphysical teachings, disciplines and techniques, from the hieroglyphic texts, are given.</p><p></p><h2>Sailor Moon 5</h2><p>Chibi-Usa gets sucked into the far reaches of space-time and vanishes!

When their underground transport arrives at the rendezvous point, chaos ensues, and Fadi is left dragging his younger sister Mariam through the crush of people. But Mariam accidentally lets go of his hand and becomes lost in the crowd, just as Fadi is snatched up into the truck. With Taliban soldiers closing in, the truck speeds away, leaving Mariam behind. <br><br>Adjusting to life in the United States isn&#x2019;t easy for Fadi&#x2019;s family and as the events of September 11th unfold the prospects of locating Mariam in a war torn Afghanistan seem slim. When a photography competition with a grand prize trip to India is announced, Fadi sees his chance to return to Afghanistan and find his sister. But can one photo really bring Mariam home? Based in part on the Ms. Senzai&#x2019;s husband&#x2019;s own experience fleeing his home in Soviet controlled Afghanistan in the 1970s, Shooting Kabul is a powerful story of hope, love, and perseverance.</p><p>N.H. Senzai is the author of <i>Shooting Kabul</i>, which was critically acclaimed and on numerous award lists. <i>Publishers Weekly </i>called it &#x201c;hard hitting, emotionally wrenching.&#x201d; Her second book, <i>Saving Kabul Corner</i>, was nominated for an Edgar Award. She is also the author of<i> Ticket to India </i>and <i>Escape from Aleppo</i>. Ms. Senzai lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her family. Visit her online at NHSenzai.com.<i>IT&#x2019;S A PERFECT NIGHT to run away,</i> thought Fadi, casting a brooding look at the bright sheen of the moon through the cracked backseat window. It reminded him of the first line of the book <i>From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.</i><br><br>&#x201c;Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi was only halfway through the first chapter, so he didn&#x2019;t know how successful Claudia had been in her getaway, old-fashioned or not, but he sure hoped that his family would be. If they weren&#x2019;t, they were going to be in an awful lot of trouble.<br><br>Under the protective cover of darkness, the taxi he and his family were traveling in swerved around a bombed-out Soviet tank and exited the pockmarked highway. They needed to avoid the checkpoints set up by black-turbaned men on the main road. With the headlights turned off, the car careened over a rocky plain, rattling the passengers&#x2019; teeth. Fadi pressed his nose against the cold glass, peering across the desolate landscape.<br><br>His reflection flashed back, revealing a thin face with unruly dark hair escaping from beneath a traditional beaded cap. His nose sloped slightly to the left, evidence he&#x2019;d broken it once. He held his breath when the driver nearly hit a tree stump while plowing through a parched wheat field. Another mile and they arrived at the outskirts of the sprawling city of Jalalabad, in the eastern province of Afghanistan.<br><br>The driver slowed, weaving his way through narrow alleys toward the crumbling buildings that rose in the distance. They bypassed quiet residential neighborhoods and a shuttered local vegetable market. Finally, the brakes squeaked in protest and the taxi came to a lurching halt alongside a row of deserted warehouses. The concrete walls were riddled with bullet holes and grenade blasts.<br><br>&#x201c;Is this it?&#x201d; asked Fadi&#x2019;s father, leaning forward in the front seat.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Habib. We&#x2019;re on the corner of Jalalkot Road and Turi Street,&#x201d; replied the driver.<br><br>Habib peered at the corner, his lips compressed in a tight line.<br><br>&#x201c;As a boy I remember coming here with my father,&#x201d; added the driver with a heavy sigh. &#x201c;For generations the merchants here created beautiful handcrafted paper.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi took in the desolate junction, trying to imagine bustling streets, shops overflowing with stacks of gleaming paper, customers haggling over prices.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, then,&#x201d; said Habib, his voice quavering for a moment. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Fadi, snap out of it,&#x201d; whispered Noor, Fadi&#x2019;s older sister. She pushed open the door and stepped out first, followed gingerly by their mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Zafoona,&#x201d; said Habib, turning to his wife, &#x201c;are you all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Zafoona, her voice a thin whisper.<br><br>Noor took her mother&#x2019;s elbow and gently propelled her toward the side of the road.<br><br>Fadi emerged next, keeping a protective hand on his younger sister, Mariam, who slid out behind him. The faint moonlight provided just enough light to help guide them into the sheltered doorstep of a shuttered tea shop nearby. Noor and Fadi&#x2019;s mother stood enveloped in burkas, two smudges of light blue against the drab gray walls.<br><br>Fadi glanced back and saw his father push a wad of cash toward the frail white-haired taxi driver, who shook his head. After a heated whispered discussion the driver finally pocketed the money and opened the trunk so that Habib could pull out their meager belongings. Fadi eyed the two scuffed suitcases. Most of what they&#x2019;d owned&#x2014;the plush carpets, color television and video player, radios, jewelry, fine china, toys, clothes and even his mother&#x2019;s beloved books&#x2014;had been sold on the black market, or used as bribes to get their paperwork and passports in order.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Salaam Alaikum</i>, and good luck, Habib,&#x201d; whispered the driver. His eyes glanced nervously over the deserted, dusty street.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Walaikum A&#x2019;Salaam</i>, Professor Sahib, and thank you for risking your life to bring us here,&#x201d; replied Fadi&#x2019;s father with a grim smile.<br><br>&#x201c;How could I not?&#x201d; replied the driver. &#x201c;You were my best student in Kabul University,&#x201d; he added, cracking a tired smile.<br><br>&#x201c;That was a long, long time ago,&#x201d; said Habib, giving the man a fierce parting hug.<br><br>The family said their good-byes and watched as the taxi disappeared down the road, its broken taillight fading into the gloom.<br><br>Fadi peered down the empty street, trying to make out the words on the broken signs lying on the dusty pavement. ZAKARIA&#x2019;S PAPER EMPORIUM read one, while another claimed to have the finest writing vellum in all of Afghanistan.<br><br>The eerie stillness was broken by muffled coughing as Zafoona covered her mouth with a handkerchief. Before she could tuck it away, Fadi saw a trace of blood on the snowy white cloth.<br><br><i>She is getting worse,</i> he thought, worry creasing his forehead. He glanced at his father, who gave him an encouraging wink and gently squeezed his shoulder. Fadi smiled in return, but he could see the fear lingering in his father&#x2019;s eyes, fear coupled with determination. As a Pukhtun, his father was bound by the ancient, sacred code of Pukhtunwali to protect his <i>namus</i>&#x2014;the women of his family&#x2014;with his life. With a shiver Fadi recalled the moment, nearly six months before, when his father had revealed his plan.<br><br>It was a blustery day in January as the family sat together at breakfast, trying to keep warm under layers of clothing. Fadi&#x2019;s mother set down a plate of old bread she&#x2019;d reheated, along with chunks of white cheese, a rare treat.<br><br>&#x201c;Ooooh!&#x201d; said Mariam. Her hazel eyes sparkled as her fork inched closer to the plate. &#x201c;Something to go with boring old bread... . Come to me, my yummy in the bummy tummy.&#x201d; At Zafoona&#x2019;s nod she speared a large sliver.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; squawked Noor in mock anger. &#x201c;Leave some for us.&#x201d; She poked Mariam in her ticklish spot, under the ribs, and got a loud giggle.<br><br>&#x201c;I only took a tiny, tiny piece!&#x201d; squealed Mariam, and wiggled out of the way.<br><br>&#x201c;Girls, behave yourselves,&#x201d; said Zafoona, casting them a weary disapproving glance.<br><br>While Mariam spread cheese on the bread, her expression turned serious. She glanced at Noor with pursed lips. &#x201c;Hey, Noor,&#x201d; she said in a loud whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;What, Ms. Yummy in the Bummy Tummy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need your help with something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will you teach me how to sew Gulmina a new dress?&#x201d; Next to Mariam&#x2019;s plate sat a Barbie that was the envy of all her friends. She&#x2019;d inherited Gulmina from Noor when her older sister had outgrown it. And now, even though the doll&#x2019;s features had faded and she was missing her left hand, Gulmina accompanied Mariam everywhere.<br><br>Noor took a piece of cheese and looked at her younger sister with a raised eyebrow.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, please, pretty please?&#x201d; begged Mariam. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do your chores this whole week&#x2014;peel the potatoes and turnips, take out the garbage, and iron the clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know ... ,&#x201d; began Noor. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even allowed to use the iron&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; cried Mariam. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do whatever you want.&#x201d; She put on her sad puppy-dog face and flashed two dimples at her older sister.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, all right.&#x201d; Noor sighed. &#x201c;I guess there&#x2019;s nothing better to do than design a new wardrobe for Gulmina the Glamorous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; said Mariam eagerly. She chattered on about what colors to use, mostly lavender and pink, while braiding Gulmina&#x2019;s patchy honey-colored hair.<br><br>Fadi tuned out his sisters&#x2019; phenomenally boring conversation, added a chunk of crumbly brown sugar to his watered-down hot milk, and stirred. He watched fat snowflakes swirl through the crisp air and land in the backyard. He shut his left eye and pretended to look through the viewfinder of his father&#x2019;s old camera, which Habib had given to Fadi for his eleventh birthday, a few months before. He squinted, framing the old plum tree against the cloudless blue sky. He wished the weather were better. Maybe he could have convinced his father to take him to the quiet back hills of the city to take pictures. But, no. It was too cold&#x2014;and too risky&#x2014;to be caught with a camera. His eye fluttered open as his father cleared his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I have something I need to tell you,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>Fadi glanced away from the accumulating snow with a frown. His father didn&#x2019;t sound like himself.<br><br>&#x201c;The situation has become too dangerous for us here,&#x201d; said Habib. There were deep circles under his eyes, as if he hadn&#x2019;t slept for many nights.<br><br><i>&#x201c;Situation.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s an understatement,</i> thought Fadi as he resumed stirring his milk. Over the past year things had gotten more and more frightening. Even going out for bread could get you in all sorts of trouble.<br><br>&#x201c;And so it&#x2019;s set. We are leaving,&#x201d; announced Habib, looking around the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Leaving?&#x201d; Fadi mumbled, blinking slowly, like a confused owl.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Noor, as her fork dropped with a loud clang.<br><br>Zafoona sat calmly. It was as if she had been expecting the news.<br><br>&#x201c;Father, what do you mean we&#x2019;re leaving?&#x201d; asked Noor.<br><br>Even Mariam, who&#x2019;d been busy scraping out the last of the honey from a metal tin, paused to stare at her father. &#x201c;<i>Why</i> are we leaving?&#x201d; she asked, her brows knitted in confusion.<br><br>&#x201c;Your mother needs better medical care,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>Fadi glanced at his mother&#x2019;s pale face. She sat shivering, cold despite wearing two sweaters, one of Habib&#x2019;s old coats, and a shawl. She&#x2019;d caught a cold at the beginning of winter and it had gotten worse. The few doctors left in Kabul didn&#x2019;t have the right equipment to diagnose what was ailing her or the right medication to make her better. She&#x2019;d taken a turn for the worse the week before when they&#x2019;d buried her mother, Fadi&#x2019;s grandmother, in the cold, hard ground next to her husband.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because of <i>them</i>, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Mariam, her eyes wise beyond her six years.<br><br>They all knew who she meant&#x2014;<i>them</i>, the Taliban.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, <i>jaan</i>.&#x201d; Habib sighed, reaching across the table to ruffle Mariam&#x2019;s fine reddish brown hair. &#x201c;The Taliban have made it very difficult for us here.&#x201d;<br><br>Zafoona cradled her steaming cup in her hands. &#x201c;It had to come to this,&#x201d; she murmured, muffling a cough.<br><br>&#x201c;You were right, Zafoona <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; Habib said with a deep sigh. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t have come back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You only had the best intentions for the country ... for the people,&#x201d; said Zafoona. She patted her husband&#x2019;s hand. Her face was laced with sadness and a trace of pity.<br><br>Mariam frowned, looking from one parent to the other. &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;We shouldn&#x2019;t have come back&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mariam <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; said Zafoona, giving her youngest daughter a resigned look. &#x201c;Remember I told you we used to live in America?&#x201d;<br><br>Mariam nodded. &#x201c;Father went to university there to get his P ... PH ... PH something.&#x201d;<br><br>Noor wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;PhD, silly. Doctorate of Philosophy in Agriculture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, PhD,&#x201d; said Mariam, grimacing at Noor&#x2019;s know-it-all-ness.<br><br>&#x201c;You were born in America, in Wisconsin,&#x201d; added Noor.<br><br>&#x201c;But why did we come back to Afghanistan, then?&#x201d; asked Mariam, her sticky fingers drumming against the table, the honey tin forgotten.<br><br>&#x201c;Father and Mother wanted to help the people in Afghanistan,&#x201d; said Fadi, trying to shut her up. He wanted to know more about how they were going to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;And you did help them? Right?&#x201d; prodded Mariam. Zafoona&#x2019;s lips tightened at her impertinence, but she stayed silent.<br><br>Fadi rolled his eyes. Mariam somehow managed to get away with everything.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, <i>jaan</i>,&#x201d; explained Habib, as if trying to remember it all himself. &#x201c;When we returned to Afghanistan, the Taliban asked me to help get rid of the country&#x2019;s vast poppy fields that were used to make drugs.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi had heard this all before, how Afghanistan had become the world&#x2019;s largest producer of opium and how the heroin derived from the poppies was ruining the country.<br><br>Mariam nodded uncomfortably. She had seen the thin, ragged drug addicts huddled on street corners, begging for scraps.<br><br>&#x201c;Slowly I convinced the farmers to destroy their poppy plants and start growing food for the hungry people,&#x201d; said Habib.<br><br>&#x201c;Your father worked very hard,&#x201d; interrupted Zafoona, &#x201c;but things didn&#x2019;t work out as we&#x2019;d hoped.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi looked at his father&#x2019;s defeated expression with growing apprehension. His father had always been optimistic, even during the most difficult times.<br><br>&#x201c;But if the Taliban did such a good thing, why are they bad now?&#x201d; asked Mariam.<br><br>&#x201c;Mariam,&#x201d; said Zafoona, her tone full of warning.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; said Habib, holding up a weary hand. He turned to Mariam, his expression solemn. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s human nature, Mariam <i>jaan</i>. Whenever someone is handed lots of power, they have a tendency to abuse it. The Taliban was a group of young religious students. When they first came to power, they brought peace and order to the country. But with time their strict interpretation of Islam began suppressing the people they&#x2019;d helped free.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why they made you grow a beard,&#x201d; Mariam said, and smiled, reaching out to stroke her father&#x2019;s face.<br><br>Habib laughed. &#x201c;Yes, they did, didn&#x2019;t they? But what they don&#x2019;t see is that you cannot force someone to be religious. It must come from their heart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair,&#x201d; burst out Noor. &#x201c;The Taliban is oppressing everyone, with a version of Islam that they&#x2019;ve cooked up. They&#x2019;ve banned everything! Music, movies, books, photography, and kite flying. Show me where it says that in the <i>Qur&#x2019;an</i>. Show me!&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi knew that wasn&#x2019;t the main reason she was upset. Although many women in Afghanistan traditionally chose to wear the burka, a head-to-toe covering&#x2014;including his grandmother and his aunts&#x2014;the Taliban now made it mandatory. Women were compelled to cover up when they ventured outside. Worst of all, they&#x2019;d closed down the girls&#x2019; schools, saying the schools would reopen when stability and safety had been restored to the country.<br><br>Zafoona murmured, &#x201c;Oppression is the worst thing in Allah&#x2019;s eyes. He forbade it not only for himself but also for us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; said Habib, &#x201c;but unfortunately, the world is full of oppression&#x2014;oppression of men against men, group against group, and nation against nation.&#x201d;<br><br>Fadi sighed. Life in Afghanistan had become more and more dangerous for their family, especially since the Taliban&#x2019;s most recent visit to their house.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d; grumbled Noor, interrupting Fadi&#x2019;s thoughts. She tapped her foot and pulled back her burka, revealing flashing brown eyes under arched eyebrows.<br><br>&#x201c;They should be here any minute,&#x201d; Habib said in a soothing voice.<br><br>Fadi pulled Mariam under the tattered awning as she tried to inch toward a skinny dog nosing through a pile of garbage. She hadn&#x2019;t spoken a word during the white-knuckled six-hour ride from their home in the capital city of Kabul. Now she clutched Gulmina at her side and looked up at Fadi, a frown marring her usually cheerful round face.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be great, you&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s lots of chocolate where we&#x2019;re going. And Barbies,&#x201d; he added with a grin.<br><br>She nodded, fingering the bright pink burka that enveloped Gulmina. Noor had sewn it for her just the week before, during a fit of boredom.

It's about no-nonsense, simple cooking with great flavors all year round. When I began writing it, I didn't really know what recipes I would come up with, but something began to inspire me very quickly . . . my vegetable patch! I came to realize last year that it's not always about looking out at the wider world for inspiration. Being at home, feeling relaxed and open, can also offer this. I love to spend time at home in the village where I grew up, working with the boss, Mother Nature, in my garden and seeing all my beautiful veggies coming out of the ground. Inside you'll find over one hundred new recipes, plus some basic planting information and tips if you fancy having a go at getting your hands dirty as well!</p><p><strong>Jamie Oliver</strong> grew up in his parents' country pub, the Cricketers in Clavering, where he started cooking at the age of eight, before studying at London's Westminster Catering College.

Oliver, host of numerous TV cooking shows and author of seven other cookbooks, is just as passionate about food and cooking as he was when he burst on the scene in <i>The Naked Chef</i>. One of his newest fascinations is with gardening, and this companion volume to a PBS series of the same name shows off the fruits of his labors in the garden he started several years ago. His recipes have always featured fresh, seasonal ingredients, but here they are organized by season and within each section by ingredient, from Crispy and Delicious Asparagus and Potato Tart in spring to the Best Winter Veg Coleslaw. Each chapter includes gardening information (e.g., how Oliver grows asparagus), and there are dozens of gorgeous color photographs.

Her reading integrates the mystery of philanthropist Thomas Anders's scandalous death with Lieutenant Eve Dallas's hot relationship with her Irish billionaire husband, Roarke. Eve's sidekick, Detective Delia Peabody, is a character of warmth and humor--in contrast to Dallas's hard-nosed, aggressive style. Ericksen portrays these various characters with unique voices that are compatible with their personalities.

A famous plastic surgeon who has dedicated his life to healing, the good doctor hasn't a clue why stalkers are out for his blood. But he knows Jane Whitefield's name--and that she is his only hope. Once again Jane performs her magic, leading Dahlman in a nightmare flight across America, only a heartbeat ahead of pursuers whose leader is a dead ringer for Jane: a raven-haired beauty who has stolen her name, reputation, and techniques--not to save lives, but to destroy them. . . .<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Jane Whitefield, Thomas Perry's Native American "guide," has recently married Dr. Carey McKinnon and is now retired from helping people disappear from danger. But when her husband's old mentor, a world-famous plastic surgeon wanted by the police for a murder he didn't commit, turns up in Carey's emergency room, Jane steps back into the shadowy world of runners and hunters one more time. In this fourth outing in Edgar-winning Perry's fascinating and innovative series, Jane discovers that someone else is using her name and reputation to take fugitives out of the world, but for very different, and diabolical, purposes. Whitefield's Seneca heritage, plus her unique talents, make her a novel and compelling heroine, and Perry's masterful storytelling makes the most of Whitefield in this suspenseful page-turner. <i>--Jane Adams</i>"Terrific. . . .

It is the driest, flattest, most desiccated, infertile and climatically aggressive of all the inhabited continents. It has more things that can kill you in a very nasty way that anywhere else. Yet when Bill Bryson travelled to Australia he promptly fell in love with the country. And who can blame him? The people are cheerful, the cities safe and clean, the food is excellent, the beer is cold and the sun nearly always shines. He tries to find out why Aussies are so cool, digging up a past that reveals convicts, explorers, gold diggers and outlaws.</p><p>Bill Bryson follows his Appalachian amble, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, with the story of his exploits in Australia, where A-bombs go off unnoticed, prime ministers disappear into the surf, and cheery citizens coexist with the world's deadliest creatures: toxic caterpillars, aggressive seashells, crocodiles, sharks, snakes, and the deadliest of them all, the dreaded box jellyfish. And that's just the beginning, as Bryson treks through sunbaked deserts and up endless coastlines, crisscrossing the "under-discovered" Down Under in search of all things interesting.<p> Bryson, who could make a pile of dirt compelling--and yes, Australia <i>is</i> mostly dirt--finds no shortage of curiosities. When he isn't dodging Portuguese man-of-wars or considering the virtues of the remarkable platypus, he visits southwest Gippsland, home of the world's largest earthworms (up to 12 feet in length). He discovers that Australia, which began nationhood as a prison, contains the longest straight stretch of railroad track in the world (297 miles), as well as the world's largest monolith (the majestic Uluru) and largest living thing (the Great Barrier Reef). He finds ridiculous place names: "Mullumbimby Ewylamartup, Jiggalong, and the supremely satisfying Tittybong," and manages to catch a cricket game on the radio, which is like </p><blockquote>listening to two men sitting in a rowboat on a large, placid lake on a day when the fish aren't biting; it's like having a nap without losing consciousness. It actually helps not to know quite what's going on. In such a rarefied world of contentment and inactivity, comprehension would become a distraction.</blockquote><p> "You see," Bryson observes, "Australia is an interesting place. It truly is. And that really is all I'm saying." Of course, Bryson--who is as much a travel writer here as a humorist, naturalist, and historian--says much more, and does so with generous amounts of wit and hilarity. Australia may be "mostly empty and a long way away," but it's a little closer now. <i>--Rob McDonald</i></p>Every time Bill Bryson walks out the door, memorable travel literature threatens to break out. His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller "A Walk in the Woods. "In A Sunburned Country is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity. <br>Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book. Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide.</p><h2>The Bridge: A Novel</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Learning </i>and <i>Leaving</i> shares a heartwarming Christmas story about a devastating flood, lost love, and the beauty of enduring friendships.</b><br><br>Number one <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Karen Kingsbury delivers an instant classic with this heartwarming Christmas story about a hundred-year flood, lost love, and the beauty of enduring friendships. <br><br><b>Molly Allen </b>lives alone in Portland, but she left her heart back in Tennessee with a man she walked away from five years ago.

She and her husband, Donald, live in Tennessee near four of their adult children.The Bridge <br>She should have said something.<br> <br>Even now, seven years later, with Thanksgiving dishes put away and another lonely December rushing up at her, Molly Allen knew the truth. Her year, her life, her Christmas . . . all of it might be different if only she&#x2019;d said something.<br> <br>The possibilities plagued her that Black Friday. They walked with her through the front door of her Portland, Oregon, private foundation office, hovered beside her over lunch at P.F. Changs, and distracted her every time she stopped in to see the cats and dogs at her animal rescue shelter.<br> <br>This was Video Day. Molly&#x2019;s day after Thanksgiving.<br> <br>Everyone else in the greater Portland area spent the day hunting bargains and stopping in at her shelter to see if the gift they wanted might be in a cage instead of a Walmart. But now, as the day wound down, while shoppers unpacked their bags and counted their savings, Molly would snuggle beneath a blanket by herself and watch the video.<br> <br>The way she did every year on this day.<br> <br>She tucked a strand of long blond hair behind her ear and stooped down to the oversize cage on the bottom row. The room echoed with a dozen different barks and whimpers and cries for attention. A chorus of unrest and slight concern from the animals rescued this month to her shelter, one arm of the Allen Foundation&#x2019;s efforts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Buster.&#x201d; She unlatched the cage and welcomed a curly-haired gray terra-poo into her arms. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your lucky day. Yes, it is.&#x201d; She snapped a leash to Buster&#x2019;s collar. The dog was a two-year-old, stuck at the shelter for three weeks. Longer than usual, considering this was Christmastime, and the cute dogs usually went first. She scratched the dog just above his ear. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get you to your family.&#x201d;<br> <br>For good measure, she made a general announcement to the others. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still seven days till December, gang. Your turn will come!&#x201d;<br> <br>Buster wagged his tail furiously as Molly led him to the lobby. She liked Buster&#x2019;s new family. Of course, she liked most families. Anyone willing to rescue a pet was a friend of hers, no question. But this family with their twin seven-year-old boys seemed special. Their eyes lit up as Molly rounded the corner with Buster.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy, that&#x2019;s him! Our Buster dog!&#x201d; One of the boys ran up and dropped to his knees, hugging Buster around his neck.<br> <br>The other boy was quieter and hung back by their parents. His grin brightened the room all the same. The family had already signed the necessary paperwork, so this was the last step. Both parents shook her hand as they left. &#x201c;What you&#x2019;re doing here, it&#x2019;s making a difference.&#x201d; The dad&#x2019;s eyes were warm. &#x201c;I have a feeling you could be doing many more things with your time.&#x201d; He nodded at her. &#x201c;Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Molly hesitated. &#x201c;Happy holidays.&#x201d;<br> <br>The family turned their attention to Buster and the excitement of getting him out the door in the pouring rain and into their van parked just outside. As the family drove off, Molly checked the time. Six minutes till closing. She walked to the door and flipped the sign. The cages were clean, and the animals all exercised by ten volunteer high school kids who had worked until an hour ago. She would check the water bowls and head home.<br> <br><br> <br>He called the video project &#x201c;The Bridge.&#x201d;<br> <br>Somewhere in the opening credits, he wrote this descriptor: How a small-town boy from Carthage, Mississippi, and a highbrow girl from Pacific Heights, California, found common ground on a daily commute down Franklin Road outside Music City to The Bridge&#x2014;the best little bookstore in the world.<br> <br>Too wordy, too many locations, Molly had told him. The two of them would laugh about how he ever could&#x2019;ve gotten an A on the assignment with such a horrific descriptor.<br> <br>Molly set her drenched things down just inside the door of her walk-up apartment, turned on the lights, and took off her dripping raincoat. She lived well below her means, in a new two-bedroom unit on the famous NW Twenty-third Street. Trees along Twenty-third sparkled with twinkling lights even in July, and the street boasted local coffee shops, caf�s, and boutiques with only-in-Portland art and fashion. The pace and people took the edge off.<br> <br>Her father would have hated it.<br> <br>Dinner simmered in the Crock-Pot, vegetable potato soup with fresh-diced leeks and garlic and parsley. The soup he taught her to make. Her Black Friday soup. A whiny meow came from the laundry room, and her cat Sam strolled up, rubbing against her ankles. He was a funny cat. More dog than feline. &#x201c;Hi, Sam.&#x201d;<br> <br>He flopped down on the kitchen floor and put his head between his paws.<br> <br>&#x201c;Exhausted, are you?&#x201d; She bent down and scratched beneath his chin. &#x201c;Good boy, Sam. Don&#x2019;t overdo it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She ladled out a small bowlful of soup, grabbed her blanket and the remote control and settled into one half of her leather loveseat. The top button on the remote dimmed the lights, and the next would start the movie, which had been in the player since early that morning.<br> <br>Molly caught her hair in her hands and pulled it to one side.<br> <br>His name was Ryan Kelly.<br> <br>Now he was married to the sweet Southern belle he&#x2019;d dated back in high school, no doubt teaching music at Carthage High in Nowhere, Mississippi. But for two years while they attended Belmont University, Ryan had been hers. She&#x2019;d dreamed of never going home again and playing violin for the philharmonic, and he&#x2019;d talked about touring with a country band, making music on his guitar for a living. In the end, he had Kristen, his Southern girl back home, and Molly had her dad&#x2019;s empire to run in San Francisco.<br> <br>But for those four sweet semesters at the Franklin bookstore, nothing came between them.<br> <br>The ending was the hardest, the final touch, the turning away, her trembling hands. Every gut-wrenching heartbeat remained etched in her soul forever. Their good-bye had happened so fast, she still wasn&#x2019;t sure she understood why. How they could&#x2019;ve parted ways so quickly and finally.<br> <br>Molly hit the play button, and as the music began, the familiar ache built inside her. She didn&#x2019;t often allow herself this trip back to then. But the day after Thanksgiving belonged to him, to the way things once were, and to the unavoidable, inescapable truth.<br> <br>Like Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind, she should&#x2019;ve said something.<br> <br><br> <br>He had set the camera up on the dashboard, rigged it with masking tape and a dowel so he could turn it slightly. The viewfinder flipped out, facing them. &#x201c;Just act natural,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;Keep your eyes on the road.&#x201d; His taped laughter rang through her living room the way it once rang through her mornings and afternoons.<br> <br>The video started with the camera on him, and his first question always made her smile. &#x201c;Okay, Miss Molly, tell the people how we met. The unlikely meeting that started the madness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The whole story?&#x201d; He had turned the camera so she came into view, her face less than agreeable as she drove her BMW sedan. &#x201c;While we&#x2019;re driving?&#x201d;<br> <br>He laughed again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s thirty minutes to The Bridge. I think you can multitask.&#x201d;<br> <br>She made a face at him and then laughed as she glanced at the camera. &#x201c;Fine. What&#x2019;s the question again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep your eyes on the road.&#x201d;<br> <br>Their laughter came together in an up-tempo waltz, while the camera caught the discreet way their bodies seemed drawn to each other. The slight but intentional way their knees and elbows brushed together and the way she looked at him as he filmed her&#x2014;as if she&#x2019;d never been happier in all her life. Molly smiled as the video played. The camera had caught their heart connection, the friendship definitely, but it had also caught the connection they hadn&#x2019;t been willing to talk about. The chemistry between them, so strong it took her breath even now.<br> <br>Their crazy undeniable chemistry.<br> <br>As the video played on, something remarkable happened, the reason Molly watched the video every year on this day. She no longer felt herself sitting in front of her TV screen watching footage shot seven years ago. Instead she was there again, the sun on her shoulders, adventure in her heart, the summer after her high school graduation. Not in a flashback sort of way. But really there. Heading into an oversize auditorium with three brand-new girlfriends for August orientation at Belmont.<br> <br>Maybe it was the sense of freedom Molly felt that day, the fact that she&#x2019;d convinced her father to let her do the unthinkable&#x2014;leave the West Coast to attend college in a flyover state like Tennessee. Or the fact that here she wasn&#x2019;t an heiress biding time until she could take over her father&#x2019;s corporation. She was a college kid, same as everyone else. Whatever it was, that day she felt wonderfully alive and hopeful, every predictable aspect of her life as far removed as the Pacific Ocean.<br> <br>That day the Belmont auditorium was filled with the energy of college freshmen excited and anxious and desperately trying to fit in. Molly and the girls took the first open seats. Her eyes had barely adjusted to the light in the auditorium when one of her friends nudged the other. &#x201c;Look at him!&#x201d; She pointed to a guy one section over. He was tall and built, with short dark hair and piercing blue eyes. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s looking at me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice try.&#x201d; The friend laughed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s looking at Molly. Same as every other guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be ridiculous. He&#x2019;s just . . .&#x201d; Molly giggled, but she couldn&#x2019;t finish her thought. Because in those few seconds, the connection between her and the dark-haired freshman was so strong it took her breath. She&#x2019;d met a number of kids by then&#x2014;through registration and lunch and field games earlier that afternoon. This felt different, and Molly knew one thing without a doubt, no matter what else happened in her four years at Belmont.<br> <br>She would never forget this single moment.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t talk, didn&#x2019;t make their way toward each other when orientation finished that evening. Molly almost wondered if her dad had someone following her, someone who would pay the guy to stay out of her way. Because her time here had come with a stipulation from her parents. She could study music, but she couldn&#x2019;t date. If her father found out she was seeing a Belmont boy, he would bring her home on the next flight.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll marry your own kind,&#x201d; he always told her. He&#x2019;d say it with a smile, but he was serious all the same. And he didn&#x2019;t mean she&#x2019;d marry just any guy in their circle of friends.<br> <br>He meant Preston J. Millington III.<br> <br>Preston had attended boarding school with her. The guy was smart and kind and personable enough. Their parents were best friends, and Preston was on the fast track for an MBA. Her father had already promised him a position with his shipping corporation.<br> <br>Molly had no feelings for Preston, but she&#x2019;d been raised to believe she didn&#x2019;t have a choice. No say in the decisions that would shape her life. Not until she set foot on the Belmont campus did her life feel remotely like it was her own. Still, by the end of the first week of school, Molly wondered if she&#x2019;d ever see the boy from orientation again.<br> <br>That Friday one of Molly&#x2019;s friends invited her over for dinner, and she said yes, the way she said yes to every invite. She loved the freedom of coming and going whenever she wanted and spending time with people regardless of their income and influence. Her friend lived in downtown Franklin, thirty minutes south of Nashville. As Molly stepped out of her sedan, she saw a guy climb out of an old Dodge truck at the house next door. He had a guitar case slung over his back, and he stopped cold when he spotted her.<br> <br>Again their eyes met, and Molly leaned on her open car door. It was him, she had no doubt. But what was he doing here? Before she could ask his name or why he was there, half an hour from campus, or what classes he was taking, her friend bounded out the front door. &#x201c;Molly! You&#x2019;re here! Come in and meet everyone. My mom&#x2019;s been cooking all day and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly pulled herself away from his deep stare and hugged her friend. They were halfway up the walk when she turned back and looked for him, but he must&#x2019;ve gone inside. All through dinner, Molly thought about him, thinking up ways to ask her friend&#x2019;s family who he was and whether he lived there or if he was visiting.<br> <br>When she left that night, his truck was gone.<br> <br>But on Monday, Molly arrived early to the music building for her instrumental theory class. As she entered the hallway, she was practically overcome by the beautiful sounds of an acoustic guitar and a guy singing a song she&#x2019;d never heard. His voice melted her, and somehow even before she rounded the corner into the room, she knew. As if she&#x2019;d known him all her life, she knew.<br> <br>Seeing him on the other side of the classroom door only confirmed it.<br> <br>He smiled and kept playing, kept singing, while she leaned against the wall and watched. When the song ended, he lowered his guitar and looked right through her. &#x201c;I was beginning to think you were a figment of my imagination.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tried to think of a witty response, but her laughter came first. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a music student?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d; He stood and shook her hand with his free one. This close, his eyes looked bluer than they had in the auditorium. &#x201c;Ryan Kelly. They had me in the wrong class. Just got it all worked out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re in here?&#x201d; Her heart soared.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I can catch up.&#x201d; He gave her a half grin and raised his brow. &#x201c;I might have a few questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>She felt her eyes start to dance. &#x201c;I might have the answers.&#x201d;<br> <br>And like that, it started.<br> <br>Neither of them lived on campus. He couldn&#x2019;t afford the room and board, so he lived in Franklin with an older couple, family friends. She lived in a house her parents owned in Brentwood&#x2019;s McGavock Farms. Her dad had bought it well below market value. He hired a crew to renovate it before school started, with plans to keep it until she left Belmont, when he would sell it for a profit. For now the house was staffed with a housekeeper and groundsman, a married couple who lived upstairs. Molly had a suite on the main floor, adjacent to the music room, where she could practice and study. Dorm living was out of the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Communal living is not suitable,&#x201d; her dad had told her. He tried to soften his expression. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know anything about that lifestyle. This way you&#x2019;ll be safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>From the beginning, her feelings for Ryan were anything but safe. And since her parents&#x2019; staff would&#x2019;ve reported her for having a boy over, Ryan&#x2019;s idea was perfect from the beginning. &#x201c;I know of this bookstore. New and used books in an old house in downtown Franklin. It has a reading room upstairs that no one uses. My home away from home.&#x201d; He smiled at her, and the sparkle in his eyes touched the depths of her soul. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called The Bridge.&#x201d;<br> <br>Molly was intrigued, and from that first study session, The Bridge became a private world for Ryan and her, a hiding place for the two of them. Sure, there were other patrons, but Belmont students didn&#x2019;t drive that far, and Molly loved the anonymity.<br> <br>The store was set up in an old house that once was a hiding place for Union soldiers during the Civil War. The floors were old weathered pine, and the walls and doors had settled so tha...</p><h2>The Techniques of Rug Weaving</h2><p>Describes the traditional and modern techniques used in handweaving all types of rugs</p><p></p><h2>The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town, 1922-1945, Revised Edition</h2><p>Book by William Sheridan Allen</p><p></p><h2>The Gunniwolf</h2><p>Instructed not to go into the woods for fear of encountering the Gunniwolf, the little girl needs to find out for herself and goes to take a look, but when she does meet the creature, she discovers something special about him and begins to wonder what all the fuss was about.</p><p>Wilhelmina Harper was a prominent children's librarian and noted anthologist and folklorist. She was born in Maine and worked in libraries in New York City, California, and France. <br><br> Barbara Upton is the illustrator of <i>Adventure on Klickitat Island</i>, by Hilary Horder Hippely, also published by Dutton.PreS-Gr. 1. A staple of story hours for decades, the tale of the Gunniwolf returns, with Harper's text reprinted almost word for word, but illustrations that are larger, brighter, and glossier than William Wiesner's pictures for the familiar 1967 version. The Gunniwolf, who resembled a lion in the old edition, now looks more like a large, overly friendly dog. The old version appeared to take place in India; the new one has an idyllic, woodland setting reminiscent of the American frontier, though the text specifies a "dense jungle." An unsigned introductory note, which calls the story "an American folktale whose origin is uncertain," offers thoughtful commentary on the tale. Some will find the art in this picture book overly sweet; others will be captivated by Upton's pretty interpretation of Harper's beautifully cadenced text. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules. Convinced that great trading was a skill that could be taught to anyone, he made a bet with his partner and ran a classified ad in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> looking for novices to train. His recruits, later known as the Turtles, had anything but traditional Wall Street backgrounds; they included a professional blackjack player, a pianist, and a fantasy game designer. For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of <em>his</em> money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made a hundred million dollars from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. </p><p>In <em>The Complete Turtle Trader</em>, Michael W. Covel, bestselling author of <em>Trend Following</em> and managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading website on the Turtles, tells their riveting story with the first ever on the record interviews with individual Turtles. He describes how Dennis interviewed and selected his students, details their education and experiences while working for him, and breaks down the Turtle system and rules in full. He reveals how they made astounding fortunes, and follows their lives from the original experiment to the present day. Some have grown even wealthier than ever, and include some of today's top hedge fund managers. Equally important are those who passed along their approach to a second generation of Turtles, proving that the Turtles' system truly is reproducible, and that anyone with the discipline and the desire to succeed can do as well as&#x2014;or even better than&#x2014;Wall Street's top hedge fund wizards.</p><p>In an era full of slapdash investing advice and promises of hot stock tips for "the next big thing," as popularized by pundits like Jim Cramer of <em>Mad Money</em>, the easy-to-follow objective rules of the TurtleTrader stand out as a sound guide for truly making the most out of your money. These rules worked&#x2014;and still work today&#x2014;for the Turtles, and any other investor with the desire and commitment to learn from one of the greatest investing stories of all time. </p></p><p><p>This is the story of how a group of rag tag students, many with no Wall Street experience, were trained to be millionaire traders. Think of Donald Trump's show "The Apprentice," played out in the real world with real money and real hiring and firing. However, these apprentices were thrown into the fire and challenged to make money almost immediately with millions at stake. They weren't trying to sell ice cream on the streets of New York City. They were trading stocks, bonds, currencies, oil and dozens of other markets to make millions.</p> <p>This story blows the roof off the conventional Wall Street success image so carefully crafted in popular culture: prestige, connections and no place at the table for the little guy to beat the market and beating the market is no small task. Legendary investor Benjamin Graham always said that analysts and fund managers as a whole could not beat the market because in a significant sense they were the market. On top of that, the academic community has argued for decades about efficient markets, once again implying there is no way to beat the market averages.</p> <p>Yet making big money, beating the market, is doable if you don't follow the herd, if you think outside the box. Anyone does have a chance to win in the market game, but he or she needs the right rules and attitude to play by. And those right rules and attitude collide against basic human nature.</p><p>Michael W. Covel is the author of the bestselling book <em>Trend Following</em>, now in its seventh printing and translated into eight languages. Covel speaks regularly on the subject of trading and is managing editor of TurtleTrader.com, the leading news and commentary resource on insights into the Turtles. He lives in California.</p></p><h2>United Nations Global Strait Jacket</h2><p>This is a handbook on world government which is also known as "the New World Order," a phrase first used by President George Bush in 1990. <p>I am asking that world government and New World Order be linked. When I first started reading about the "New World Order" I had no idea that it was world government...no one ever made the connection for me. We have to explain that they are one in the same. </p><p>Many Americans know or feel somthing is very wrong, but are not able to put their finger on the problem. This book will help them to connect the dots - politically, economically, and environmentally. "Global Straitjacket" will explain the Hegelian Dialectic, "reinventing government," public-private partnerships and how it replaces the Constitution, "globalization," the move toward a world stock market and a cashless society, an international criminal court which transcends national boundaries, and much more. Above all it will provide the reader with an understanding of the governmental aspects of the United Nations and how its power transcends from the international to the local level, all with the blessings of our federal government. </p><p>Joan Veon writes: "Jesus Christ was born into world government. The early church certainly understood the rules of Rome and worked around and through it without becoming part of it or adding to it. In contrast, the end-time church is going into world government without knowing or understanding its agenda, and therefore blind as to how to stand in the gap." </p><p>Above all, this book is a call to stand in the gap which is our God-given mandate - and the bottom line to our total existence and Christian call!</p></p><p>Up until September 1994, Joan Veon was just a businesswoman. As a result of attending her first United Nations conference in Cairo, Egypt, she received her "wake-up call," as there was more going on at the global level than most Americans knew, understood, or were being told. <p>In her determination to understand the global level and what it really means for Americans, she has attended more than twenty-five U.N. and U.N.-related conferences since September 1994 on topics ranging from the social to the economic, the environment and reinventing the government. The level of conference has varied as well, from the U.N. mega-conferences in Cairo, Copenhagen, Istanbul, and Rome, to IMF/World Bank meetings, to Group of Seven/Group of Eight meetings, the International Organization for Security Commissions, the Rio plus Five in March 1997, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and the fiftieth anniversary of NATO. </p><p>Joan has reported for USA Radio Network, the Michael Reagan Show, the Jane Chastain Show, and the Lou Epton Show, to name a few. </p><p>As an international journalist, Joan has asked questions of presidents, prime ministers, key United Nations/IMF/World Bank officials, Bank for International Settlements executives, high officials in the Clinton administration, multinational CEO, and others in order to understand the global agenda and how it relates to the local level. </p><p>In her capacity as a businesswoman for fifteen years, Joan writes a quarterly economic newsletter which has become more global in its reporting in an effort to identify and name key economic players. Her firm, Veon Financial Services, Inc., is a Registered Investment Advisor. </p><p>In order to help with the expenses of covering international conferences, Joan started the Women's International Media Group, Inc., which is a 501(c)(3) educational corporation. Those looking to help inform others are welcome to support this endeavor. </p><p>Lastly, Joan has authored a number of briefing books documenting her research. Her book "Prince Charles: The Sustainable Prince," which is in its third printing, discusses her view of world politics which states that when America signed the U.N. Charter we officially entered world government and reverted back to Britain. She documents the partnership between the Prince of Wales, the United Nations, and the World Bank. She shows the real Prince Charles as a very powerful man to watch!</p></p><h2>Storey&#39;s Guide to Raising Ducks: Breeds, Care, Health</h2><p>For 17 years readers have turned to Storey Books for advice on raising animals.

She stood still and listened, but there came no answering cry from her brother.</i></p><p><i>She called his name again, louder this time, but with the same result. Or, rather, the same lack of result.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;if I were to climb to the top of that curio, I would be able to see quite far along the path.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>She approached the hulking cabinet and opened the doors at the bottom. There was nothing inside. She slid open a drawer and pulled it out, set it beside her on the grass. She pulled herself up, hanging on tight to the knurled trim along the side, and used the empty slot where the drawer had been as a toe-hold. Once begun, the climb was easy, shelves positioned at convenient intervals as if it had all been purposefully fashioned for small children to scale. At the top was an elegant pointed facade and she clung to it and crouched low, willing herself not to look back down at the ground. &#x201c;I am not really so high up, after all,&#x201d; she thought. &#x201c;Were I to fall, I might not break my arms and legs.&#x201d; But this thought was not so comforting as she had felt it would be.</i></p><p><i>She looked ahead of her up the path, which wound around a dining set and through a great herd of French desk chairs, disappearing at the juncture of a Chippendale butcher block and a dollhouse cupboard. A small blue bird of some sort hopped from the base of a painted white sideboard, then flapped away to the top of a jumbled mountain of coatracks. Behind her, she could see that the sun was beginning to set, the sky bruised and livid.</i></p><p><i>She opened her mouth to call Peter again, but did not make a sound. All at once she felt utterly alone and afraid.</i></p><p><i>A grandfather clock chimed nearby. Startled, Anna lost her grip on the facade and nearly tumbled from her perch. She slid down the back of the curio and landed neatly on her feet on the packed dirt of the path.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she thought, &#x201c;I suppose there is nothing for it but to find Peter and drag him back home in time for his supper. Otherwise, we shall both get the switch and I should never forgive him if that happened.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>And so she mustered her resolve and marched away into the ever-darkening Wood without glancing back even once at the warm yellow lights of her house.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&#x2014; Rupert Winthrop, from <i>The Wandering Wood</i> (1893)</p><p>Prologue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He woke in the dark and saw that his cell door was open.</p><p>Just a crack, but lamplight shone through and into the room.&nbsp; He lay on his cot and watched that chink of yellow through his shivering eyelashes. But the door didn&#x2019;t open any farther and the man&#x2014;<i>the man Jack&#x2014;</i>didn&#x2019;t enter the room. Had Jack forgotten to latch the door after his last visit? Or was he waiting to pounce, somewhere just out of sight in the passage beyond the cell?</p><p>He kept his eyes half-shut and watched the door for an hour. The sun came up and the quality of light in the room changed. The crack between the door and the jamb remained the same, but the lamplight behind it faded, washed out by the brighter gleam of the rising sun. At last, he threw his thin grey blanket aside and sat up, swung his legs over the side of the cot and padded across the room to the bucket in the corner. When he had finished the morning&#x2019;s business, he scooped sand into the bucket and went to the table under the window. He splashed water on his face from the bowl, his back to the open door, ignoring it. He drank from a ladle and looked out through the bars at the narrow stony yard, all he could see of the outside world. Then he went back to the cot and sat down and waited.</p><p>His breakfast didn&#x2019;t come, but sometimes it didn&#x2019;t. Sometimes Jack forgot or was busy. A missed meal here or there was hardly the end of the world. So he sat and he waited. He began to worry when midday passed without any sign of food. His stomach grumbled. He checked the positions of the shadows in the yard, but they told him nothing he didn&#x2019;t already know. He had an excellent internal clock. He knew full well when it was time to eat.</p><p>When teatime passed with no tea or bread, he stood again and went to the door. He put his hand on the knob and closed his eyes. He concentrated on his breathing, calmed himself. He pulled the door half an inch wider and took his hand off the knob. He stood behind the door and braced himself.</p><p>But nothing happened.</p><p>Braver now, he touched the doorknob again, wrapped his fist around it and opened the door wide enough that he could see out into the hallway. He put his head out of the room and pulled it back immediately. But despite his expectations, nothing had hit him or cut him. Nobody had laughed at him or screamed at him. All was quiet.</p><p>And so he stepped out of the room for the first time in as long as he could remember. He wasn&#x2019;t at all comfortable being outside his cell. His memory of the things beyond that room was vague and untrustworthy. He swallowed hard and looked back at his cot. It represented all he knew, relative security bound up with stark terror, the twin pillars that supported his existence.</p><p>He left it behind and crept down the passage on his bare feet, leaving the lantern where it hung on a peg outside the chamber. When he reached the end of the hallway there was another door and he seized the knob without flinching. He stifled a gasp when it turned under his hand and the second door swung open, revealing a long wedge of wan afternoon sunlight. He had expected the door to be locked, had expected to have to turn around and retreat to his cell and his cot and his bucket. Had, in fact, almost wished for it.</p><p>He stepped out into fresh air. He felt the warmth of the sunbaked stones on the soles of his feet. When his eyes had accustomed themselves to the bright light, he looked around him at the empty street and turned and looked up at the nondescript house that had been his home for so long. He didn&#x2019;t ever remember seeing the front of the house before and it occurred to him that he might have been born there, might never have been outside it. Perhaps his half-remembered notions of the world beyond his cell were only dreams.</p><p>A breeze stirred the hair on his bare arms and he felt suddenly self-conscious. After hesitating a moment, he turned and went back inside, back down the passage, back into his room, to the cot. He picked up his grey blanket and draped it over his shoulders and left again.</p><p>Back outside he looked up and down the street and smiled. He had a choice to make and he felt proud to have been given the opportunity. Jack was testing him, he was sure of it. He could go left to the end of the road where he saw another street running perpendicular to this one. Or he could go right. Far away to his right he could see the green tops of trees waving to him from somewhere over a steep hill. Perhaps a park or a garden. Trees. He could imagine how their bark would feel under the palm of his hand. He was certain he had touched trees before. He really had been outside his room. He nodded. The trees meant something.</p><p>Walter Day turned to his right and limped naked down the street toward the beckoning green.</p><p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Plumm&#x2019;s Emporium had for years occupied a large building at the south end of Moorgate, not far from where Walter Day spent a year in captivity and not far from Drapers&#x2019; Gardens, where Day found shelter in the trees. Plumm&#x2019;s was bordered on one side by an accountant&#x2019;s office and on the other by that famous Gentlemen&#x2019;s Club: Smithfield and Gordon. In the winter of 1890 it had been announced that Smithfield would be moving to posher headquarters in Belgravia and the renowned entrepreneur John Plumm purchased the club&#x2019;s building. At the same time, he made an offer to the accountant, who was only too glad to relocate. The Emporium then closed its doors for nearly four months. The great blizzard that hit London in March of 1891 slowed construction of the new building and caused much speculation about Plumm&#x2019;s financial stability. There were rumors that corners had been cut and cheaper materials used in order to get the place ready for the announced date. But when it reopened it was three times the size and four stories taller and had adopted its founder&#x2019;s name, John Plumm, though most shoppers continuing to refer to it simply as Plumm&#x2019;s.</p><p>Beyond the cast iron and glass storefront, the ground floor of Plumm&#x2019;s held two tea shops, a bank, three full restaurants, a public reading room, and a confectionary. There was an electric lift at the back, something most people had never seen, and this generated a fair amount of foot traffic, people coming in just to ride up and down. The first through third stories were supported by thick iron pillars and held a staggering variety of merchandise: toys and dolls, fabric of every variety, ready-made clothing, shoes and umbrellas and hats, groceries, baked goods and bedding, mens ties and cufflinks, coffee, books and maps and sheet music, jewelry, cutlery and crockery and cookware, rooms for lounging, rooms for smoking, and fitting rooms. At the top of the building was an enormous glass dome which was cleaned daily, along with the forty-three windows on the lower floors, by four men hired specifically for that purpose.</p><p>John Plumm himself gave a speech on the day of the opening and then stepped aside, gesturing wide for the gathered throng to enter. Men wearing white gloves held the doors open as hundreds of women (and more than a few men) hurried inside, and more staff waited within holding complimentary brandy and wine balanced on silver trays. These men, along with two hundred other Plumm&#x2019;s employees, were housed on-site in apartments that faced Coleman Street. In this way, as John Plumm explained, there was always someone in the store, and no customer would ever want for advice or service.</p><p>There was a workshop next to the apartments at the back, where skilled artisans created papier mache mannequins and display racks made of wood and brass.</p><p>John Plumm was rarely seen on the premises, but his lieutenant Joseph Hargreave, who managed the daily affairs of the store, constantly patrolled the floor, adjusting scarves on the mannequins, resolving customer issues, and replacing the employees&#x2019; soiled white gloves when needed. Hargreave had an eagle eye for imperfections among his workers and had shown three shopgirls the door before end of business on Plumm&#x2019;s opening day.</p><p>But he did not show up for work the second week after Plumm&#x2019;s opened its doors to the public, leading many of his employees to think that perhaps Mr Plumm had taken matters into his own hands and let his overzealous manager go. Joseph Hargreave was never seen alive again and was quickly forgotten by everyone. Everyone, that is, except his brother Richard, who eventually decided to hire a private investigator to find Joseph.</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On Monday, the evening after he left his cell, Walter Day hid, shivering, behind a stand of trees until Drapers&#x2019; Gardens had emptied. When he was alone he pulled up the grass beneath him and dug a shallow trench in the hard soil. He lay down and hugged his legs to his chest, waited until his teeth stopped chattering, and he eventually fell asleep.</p><p>Tuesday morning Walter kept himself hidden at the edge of the gardens until a vendor stepped away from his wagon long enough to scold a band of street urchins that were driving customers away. Walter snatched a loose cotton dress from the vendor&#x2019;s awning where it hung. He pulled it over his head, then hungry and filthy and ashamed, but no longer naked, he scurried away. He clung to the side of the footpath, away from traffic and tried to seem inconspicuous in his lady&#x2019;s dress, his bare feet visible below the hem. He found a half a fish pie discarded in the slush at the side of the road and ate it as quickly as he could, cramming the soggy mess into his mouth so fast that he couldn&#x2019;t breathe. He watched the shadows and the passing people, while waiting for the man Jack to appear and take him back to his cell. When teatime had come and gone again, and Jack still had not materialized, Walter began to cry.</p><p>Wednesday, as omnibuses rattled past carrying early morning commuters, Day crawled out of the box he had slept in and joined the flow of pedestrians. When he came to a busy intersection, he watched a gang of children who rushed forward, one at a time, to assist people as they crossed the wet road, holding up their hands to halt the buses and taxis and private carriages, and collecting small coins in return. Hopeful, Walter caught a young woman&#x2019;s attention and held out his elbow for her. She looked away, her cheeks red with embarrassment, and a man standing behind Walter threatened to send for the police. As the foot traffic thinned, it began to sleet. He took shelter beneath an oriel and sat on the ground, pulled his muddy dress down so that it covered his ankles, and waited.</p><p>On Thursday he returned to that same corner and watched the children more carefully, studied how they solicited pedestrians, and by afternoon had managed to help an elderly blind man cross the street. He earned a ha&#x2019;penny in return and spent it on a cup of weak tea at a wagon across from the gardens. He slept in the trench again and used the dress as a blanket.</p><p>When he woke Friday morning, he found a small pile of clothing had been left on the ground next to him. A pair of patched and faded trousers, a threadbare shirt, a thick wool coat, and boots with a hole in one toe. Next to the clothing was a walking stick with a round brass handle. He recognized it as his own, from some long ago time, like seeing a cherished toy he had played with as a child. He looked around, but saw no one, and so he put on the new clothes and buried his dress next to the trench so that it would not be stolen or discarded. More appropriately attired, he was able to help seven people cross the busy intersection that day and, for the first time since leaving his cell, he ate an entire meal. That night he slept well and was not bothered by any rumblings in his stomach.</p><p>The children were waiting for him at his corner on Saturday. Walter listened as they explained their position. This was their corner and, although he was much larger than they were, they outnumbered him and would cause him grievous harm if he continued to interfere with their ability to earn a living. He nodded and wished them well and wandered away in search of another intersection. He had no luck, but later that day he was struck on the back of the head by a cigar butt that was carelessly tossed from a passing carriage. He picked up the smoldering butt and carried it away with him. Over the course of two hours, he found nearly twenty more, an even mix of cigars and cigarettes. He took them back to his trench in the gardens and unrolled them all, using a piece of bark stripped from a tree to catch the precious bits of tobacco left inside them. It took some time, but eventually he was able to form two new crude-looking cigars from the leftovers. He took off hi...</p></p><h2>Everybody&#39;s Fool: A novel</h2><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>2016 Notable Book<br><br>An immediate national best seller and instant classic from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Empire Falls</i>.&nbsp;Richard Russo returns to North Bath&#x2014;&#x201c;a town where dishonesty abounds, everyone misapprehends everyone else and half the citizens are half-crazy&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>)&#x2014;and the characters who made <i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool</i> a beloved choice of book clubs everywhere.&nbsp;<i>Everybody&#x2019;s Fool </i>is classic Russo, filled with humor, heart, hard times, and people you can&#x2019;t help but love, possibly because their various faults make them so human.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Everybody&#x2019;s Fool</i> picks up roughly a decade since we were last with Miss Beryl and Sully on New Year's Eve 1984.

In 2002 he received the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Empire Falls,</i> which like <i>Nobody&#x2019;s Fool </i>was adapted to film, in a multiple-award-winning HBO miniseries.Triangle<br><br>Hilldale cemetery in North Bath was cleaved right down the middle, its Hill and Dale sections divided by a two-�lane macadam road, originally a colonial cart path. Death was not a thing unknown to the town&#x2019;s first hearty residents, but they seemed to have badly misjudged how much of it there&#x2019;d be, how much ground would be needed to accommodate those lost to harsh winters, violent encounters with savages and all manner of illness. Or was it life, their own fecundity, they&#x2019;d miscalculated? Ironically, it amounted to the same thing. The plot of land set aside on the outskirts of town became crowded, then overcrowded, then chock-�full, until finally the dead broke containment, spilling across the now-�paved road onto the barren flats and reaching as far as the new highway spur that led to the interstate. Where they&#x2019;d head next was anybody&#x2019;s guess.<br><br>Though blighted by Dutch elm disease in the &#x2019;70s and more recently by a mold that attacked tree roots, causing them to weaken and constrict and allowing the ground, without warning, to collapse in pits, the original Hill section was still lovely, its mature plantings offering visitors shade and cool breezes. The gentle, rolling terrain and meandering gravel pathways felt natural and comfortable, even giving the impression that those resting beneath its picturesque hummocks&#x2014;�some interred before the Revolutionary War&#x2014;�had come there by choice rather than necessity. They seemed not so much deceased as peacefully drowsing beneath tilting headstones that resembled weathered comfy hats worn at rakish angles. Given the choice of waking into a world even more full of travail than the version they left, who could blame them for punching the snooze button and returning to their slumbers for another quarter century or so?<br><br>By contrast, the newer Dale was as flat as a Formica tabletop and every bit as aesthetically pleasing. Its paved pathways were laid out on a grid, the more contemporary grave sites baked and raw looking, its lawn, especially the stretch nearest the highway, a quilt of sickly yellows and fecal browns. The adjacent acreage, where the Ultimate Escape Fun Park had once been pictured, was boggy and foul. Lately, during periods of prolonged rain, its pestilential groundwater tunneled under the road, loosening the soil and tugging downhill the caskets of those most recently interred. After a good nor&#x2019;easter there was no guarantee that the grave site you visited featured the same casket as the week before. To many the whole thing defied logic. With all that seeping water, the Dale should have been richly verdant, whereas everything planted there shriveled and died, as if in sympathy with its permanent, if shifty, inhabitants. There had to be contamination involved, people said. All those putrid acres had been used as an unofficial dump for as long as anybody could remember, which was why they&#x2019;d been purchased so cheaply by the fun park&#x2019;s planners. Recently, during a prolonged drought, dozens of leaking metal drums decorated with skulls and crossbones had surfaced. Some were old and rusty, leaking God-�only-�knew-what; other newcomers were labeled &#x201c;chrome,&#x201d; which cast a pall of suspicion on neighboring Mohawk, a town once rich in tanneries, but these accusations were emphatically and for the most part convincingly denied. Anybody wanting to know what those tanneries did with their dyes and carcinogenic chemicals only had to visit the local landfill, the stream that ran through town or the hospital&#x2019;s oncology ward. Still, didn&#x2019;t the drums of toxic slurry have to come from somewhere? Downstate most likely. On this point the history of New York was unambiguous. Shit&#x2014;�both liquid and solid, literal and metaphorical&#x2014;�ran uphill in defiance of physics, often into the Catskills, at times all the way to the Adirondacks.<br><br>No jaunty, charming grave markers in Dale. Here the stones were laid purposefully flat so they couldn&#x2019;t be tipped over by teenage hooligans. Bath&#x2019;s legendary eighth-�grade English teacher, Beryl Peoples, whose dim view of human nature she occasionally shared in acerbic letters to the North Bath Weekly Journal, had warned what would happen. With all the stones lying flat, she cautioned, and without any trees or hedgerows to provide an obstacle, visitors would treat the cemetery like a supermarket parking lot and drive directly to whatever grave they had in mind. This warning had been dismissed as perverse and outrageous, a slander on the citizenry, but the old woman had been vindicated. Not a week went by without someone calling the police station to report tire tracks across Grandma&#x2019;s headstone, right where her survivors imagined her upturned, beatific face to be. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you like it if somebody drove a pickup over your skull?&#x201d; the angry caller would want to know.<br><br>Chief of Police Douglas Raymer, arriving at Hilldale late to witness the interment of Judge Barton Flatt, was always at a loss how to respond to such queries, which seemed to him so fundamentally flawed that you couldn&#x2019;t even tell if they were real questions. Were people inviting him to draw the obvious distinction between driving an automobile over an ancestor&#x2019;s grave&#x2014;�an insensitive, inconsiderate act, sure&#x2014;�and driving it over a living person&#x2019;s head, obviously a homicidal and criminal one? How was it helpful for him to imagine what either felt like? It was as if people expected him to make sense of both the physical world and its miscreants, the latter too numerous to count, too various to explicate, the former too deeply mysterious to fathom. When had either become part of the police chief&#x2019;s job description? Wasn&#x2019;t explaining the world&#x2019;s riddles and humans&#x2019; behaviors what philosophers and psychiatrists and priests were paid to do? Most of the time Raymer had no idea why he himself did what he did, never mind other people.<br><br>Whatever his job was, most days&#x2014;�and today was certainly no exception&#x2014;�it sucked. As a patrolman he&#x2019;d imagined that, as chief, his hours would be filled with genuine police work, or at least real public service, but after two terms he now knew better. Of course in North Bath most crimes didn&#x2019;t demand much detective work. A woman would turn up at the hospital looking like somebody&#x2019;d beaten the shit out of her, claiming she tripped over her child&#x2019;s toy. When you visited her husband and offered to shake, the hand he reluctantly extended looked more like a monstrous fruit, purple and swollen, the skin splitting and oozing interior juices. But even such dispiritingly mundane investigations were fascinating compared with Raymer&#x2019;s current duties as chief of police. When he wasn&#x2019;t attending the funerals of people he didn&#x2019;t even like or addressing groups of &#x201c;concerned citizens&#x201d; who seemed less interested in any solutions he might propose than how much churlish invective he could be forced to swallow, he was a glorified clerk, a mere functionary who spent his time filling out forms, reporting to selectmen, going over budgets. Some days he never got out from behind his desk. He was getting fat. Also, the pay really sucked. Okay, sure, he made more than he had as a patrolman, but not enough more to cover the endless aggravation. He supposed he could live with the fact that the job sucked if he was any good at it, but the truth was that he sucked. He had no idea what he&#x2019;d have done without Charice&#x2014;�speaking of aggravation&#x2014;�and her incessant badgering. Because she was right, he was increasingly forgetful and unfocused and preoccupied. Since Becka . . .<br><br>But no, he wasn&#x2019;t going to think about her. He would not. He would concentrate on the here and now.<br><br>Which was hot as Uganda. By the time Raymer crossed the cemetery parking lot and walked the hundred or so yards to where a couple dozen mourners were clustered around Judge Flatt&#x2019;s open grave, he was drenched in sweat. Such punishing heat was unheard of in May. Here in the foothills of the Adirondacks, Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial beginning of summer, was almost always profoundly disappointing to the region&#x2019;s winter-�ravaged populace, who seemed to believe they could will summer into being. They would have their backyard barbecues even when temperatures dipped into the high forties and they had to dig out their parkas. They would play softball, even after a week&#x2019;s worth of frigid rains made a soupy mess of the diamond. If a pale, weak sun came out they would go out to the reservoir to water-�ski. But this year the town&#x2019;s fervent prayers had been answered, as they so often were, at least in Raymer&#x2019;s experience, with ironic vengeance. Midnineties for the past three days, no end in sight.<br><br>Raymer would&#x2019;ve been more than content to suffer on the periphery of today&#x2019;s proceedings, but he mistakenly made eye contact with the mayor, who, before he could look away, motioned for him to join the other dignitaries, which he reluctantly did. Yesterday, he&#x2019;d tried his best to weasel out of this funeral, even going so far as to volunteer Charice, who was growing increasingly desperate to get away from the station house, to attend in his place. He&#x2019;d explained to Gus that he not only had no particular affection for Barton Flatt but also counted him among the many banes of his existence. But the mayor was having none of it. The judge had been an important man, and Gus expected Raymer not just to attend but to be decked out in his dress blues, heat or no heat.<br><br>So here he was under the punishing, unseasonable sun, honoring a man who&#x2019;d disdained him for the better part of two decades. Not that Raymer was alone in this. Disdain was His Honor&#x2019;s default mode, and he made no secret that he considered all human beings venal (a term Raymer had to look up) and feckless (another). If he disliked criminals, he was even less fond of lawyers and policemen, who in his opinion were supposed to know better. The very first time Raymer had been summoned to the judge&#x2019;s chambers, after accidentally discharging his weapon, the judge had fixed him with his trademark baleful stare for what had felt like an eternity before turning his attention to Ollie North, the chief back then. &#x201c;You know my thoughts on arming morons,&#x201d; he told Ollie. &#x201c;You arm one, you have to arm them all. Otherwise it&#x2019;s not even good sport.&#x201d; Over the years Raymer had had numerous opportunities to improve the man&#x2019;s low estimation of him but had managed only to worsen it.<br><br>But of course there was another reason Raymer had tried to weasel out of this. He hadn&#x2019;t been back to Hilldale since Becka&#x2019;s funeral, and he wasn&#x2019;t at all sure how he&#x2019;d react to her proximity. He was pretty sure she was out of his system, but what if the shock and pain of her loss came flooding back and he broke down and started sobbing over the memory of a woman who&#x2019;d made a complete fool of him? What if legitimate mourners witnessed his blubbering? Wouldn&#x2019;t his unmanly sorrow make a mockery of their more heartfelt grief?<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; Gus said out of the corner of his mouth, when Raymer joined him.<br><br>Excerpted from <b>Everybody&#x2019;s Fool</b> by Richard Russo Copyright � 2016 by Richard Russo.

One of these, BILL PEET: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, was named a 1989 Caldecott Honor Book. All of Bill Peet&#x2019;s books published by Houghton Mifflin Company, including his first book for children published in 1959, HUBERT'S HAIR-RAISING ADVENTURE, remain actively in print today. <br><br>In both his career as an author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books and in his work as sketch artist and continuity illustrator at Walt Disney, Bill Peet created a menagerie of memorable characters. As he himself noted, "I write about animals because I love to draw them. Most of my animal characters have human personalities, and some are much like the people I know."<br><br>At Walt Disney, where Bill Peet worked for 27 years, he was a key participant in the production of classic films such as Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, and 101 Dalmatians for which he was not only an artist, but the screenwriter as well. <br><br>Bill Peet&#x2019;s signature style enabled him to create fast-paced stories of fantastical adventure delivered with warmth and laugh-out-loud hilarity. His unfailing humor did not, however, prevent him from addressing such poignant issues as kindness toward others and respect for the environment. Through the exploits of his characters, Peet offered his audience a chance to see themselves and their world through new eyes.<br><br>"At some point," Bill Peet once said, "it occurred to me that drawing was something I couldn&#x2019;t possibly give up, and somehow it must be turned into a profession." He went on to not only fulfill his dream but to introduce generations of young readers to his delightful vision of humor, friendship and compassion.<br>As caboose Katy clicks along the tracks, bringing up the rear of a large and noisy freight train, she gazes longingly at her stationary surroundings. If only she could stay put in a country town or on a hillside and enjoy the fresh air and solitude. If only there could be no more scary tunnels, mountainside ledges, or smoke-filled train yards. Narrator Josefina Bosch keeps a steady beat, mimicking the train's travel and highlighting Bill Peet's signature rhymes. She projects Katy's longings and rejoices in her big surprise. Sound effects of trains provide an authentic background. For Bill Peet aficionados, the production also includes a reading of "The Whingdingdilly"--who is not your ordinary dog!

His <i>Bad Haircut: Stories of the Seventies</i> is a delightful collection of coming-of-age stories, which give insight into the joys and agonies of adolescence. In Perrotta's first full-length novel <i>The Wishbones</i>, a 31-year-old musician can't quite cope with the responsibilities of adulthood and instead lives an extended adolescence. Perrotta's much-anticipated second novel <i>Election</i> again successfully ventures into the adolescent psyche. <p> The book is set in a New Jersey high school amidst a hotbed of political activity: students are voting for their school president. Perrotta's cast of characters are exaggerated but convincing. They convey adolescence as it often is--sometimes painful and frequently awkward. Tracy is the popular girl, smart and pretty, but she isn't quite as perfect as her classmates assume. A sordid affair with a teacher lurks in the shadows. Paul is the jovial football jock, but his parent's divorce has left him hurt and vulnerable. Then there is Paul's younger and geekier sister Tammy, the tormented underdog struggling with her sexuality. Plot develops through a series of mini-chapters, narrated by the main protagonists. There are also frequent interjections from Mr. M, the all-around good teacher every kid loves--the kind of teacher Hollywood loves to enshrine in sentimental flicks. A genuine crescendo of excitement and anticipation consumes the reader, as we eagerly await who has won the election. This is a novel of teenagers on the brink of adulthood, and is probably best appreciated by grownups with enough perspective on their own adolescent experiences to be able to take the bitter with the sweet.</p>Tom Perrotta teaches writing at Harvard.</p><h2>Easy Grammar Grade 6</h2><p>The ISBN 0936981466 is for the workbook.

At a time when we may appropriately begin to assess his contributions to 20th century art, this book and exhibition span the wide range of his creativity, from the earliest work of the fifties to works executed just before his untimely death, in February 1987. Through his art, ideas, and style, Andy Warhol left a lasting imprint on the history of modern art and on our culture.</p><p>"There will always be a pre- and a post-Warhol," writes Philippe Tretiack, "and that post-Warhol period is having difficulty establishing itself." There also will always be people who consider Andy Warhol's work to represent the beginning of the end of serious cultural life in America. A flagrantly commercial antihero of the gay, big-city subculture, Warhol offended in so many ways. His cheerful, absurdist pop images of Campbell's soup cans, Jackie Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and the electric chair made serious subject matter with serious meaning a thing of the past. Everything Warhol did made serious film, painting, drawing, or printmaking look slightly silly. He flaunted his disregard for the pretensions of the fine artist, calling his studio "the Factory," churning out multiples, and publicly insisting that his work could be fabricated by practically anyone (until it was pointed out to him that this would significantly lower his prices). <p> In an excellent essay in the front of this small book, Tretiack places Warhol historically and esthetically, hitting all the high points of Warhol's flamboyant career and stylishly discussing the legacy of this '60s bad boy. The rest of the book is full of pictures--mostly Warhol's more famous images, but also some snapshots of Andy. Missing are a few pictures of Warhol's graceful, elegant shoe drawings and recipe illustrations, showing the kind of fine-art facility with which the artist began his career. But the rest is packed in here in all its flashy vainglory, including the green-tinged picture of a smiling Tricky Dick Nixon with the hand-lettered admonishment "Vote McGovern." At the end of the book are a brief chronology and a list of captions for the plates. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p></p><h2>Country Beans - How to cook dry beans in only 3 minutes!</h2><p><i>Country Beans</i><br> Learn to cook dry BEANS in only 3 minutes!<br> Soups, Sauces and Gravies in 3 Minutes - Dips in 5 Minutes!<br> by Rita Bingham <p>400 heart-healthy cholesterol-free bean recipes-guaranteed to become your family favorites!

Swensen has transformed the management of the university's portfolio. Largely by focusing on nonconventional strategies, including a heavy allocation to private equity, Swensen has achieved an annualized return of 16.2 percent, which has propelled Yale's endowment into the top tier of institutional funds. Now, this acknowledged leader of fund managers draws on his experience and deep knowledge of the financial markets to provide a compendium of powerful investment strategies.<p>Swensen presents an overview of the investment world populated by institutional fund managers, pension fund fiduciaries, investment managers, and trustees of universities, museums, hospitals, and foundations. He offers penetrating insights from his experience managing Yale's endowment, ranging from broad issues of goals and investment philosophy to the strategic and tactical aspects of portfolio management. Swensen's exceptionally readable book addresses critical concepts such as handling risk, selecting investment advisers, and negotiating the opportunities and pitfalls in individual asset classes. Fundamental investment ideas are illustrated by real-world concrete examples, and each chapter contains strategies that any manager can put into action.</p><p>At a time when it is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with the relentless challenges provided by today's financial markets, Swensen's book is an indispensable roadmap for creating a successful investment program for every institutional fund manager. Any student of markets will benefit from <b>Pioneering Portfolio Management.</b></p></p><p><b>David F. Swensen</b> is the chief investment officer of Yale University and the bestselling author of <i>Pioneering Portfolio Management</i>. He serves on the boards of TIAA, The Brookings Institution, Carnegie Institution, and Hopkins School. At Yale, where he produced an unparalleled two-decade investment record of 16.1 percent-per-annum returns, he teaches economics classes at Yale College and finance classes at Yale?s School of Management. Mr. Swensen lives in New Haven, Connecticut.Swensen has been the chief investment officer for the past 14 years at Yale University, where he is responsible for managing and investing more than $6 billion of the university's endowment assets and investment funds. Realizing an annual return of more than 16 percent on his investments, Swensen has added more than $2 billion to Yale's coffers, and his consistent track record has attracted the notice of Wall Street portfolio managers. Here Swensen provides a brief history of endowment funds and explains the purpose of endowment accumulation and the goals for institutional portfolios. One of the strategies behind his success has been to diversify asset classes and move beyond a reliance on domestic marketable securities. He distinguishes between traditional and alternative asset classes, looks at performance evaluation issues and tools, and considers the investment decision-making process. Although its audience will be limited, this book is a necessary purchase for libraries with collections that include the topic of investment management. <i>David Rouse</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This fresh and astute account offers a unique perspective on this era of twentieth-century history. <br><br>Covering the years from 1907 to 1933, Haffner's personal memories form the basis for questioning, analyzing, and interpreting much of Germany's history. His eyewitness account of groups such as the First Free Corps -- the right-wing voluntary military force set up to suppress communism during the revolution of 1918 -- which would provide training for many of the later Nazi storm troopers; the Hitler Youth movement, which swept the nation; the apocalyptic year of 1923 when inflation crippled the country; the peaceful Stresemann years; and Hitler's coming to power all contribute to the portrait of a country in a constant state of flux. Sebastian Haffner elucidates how the educated average German grappled with a rapidly changing society, while chronicling day-to-day changes in attitudes, beliefs, politics, and prejudices.<br><br>Available for the first time in English, this highly illuminating work is a unique portrait of a time, a place, and a people.<br></p><p>What was it about Germany that made the rise of Adolf Hitler and his murderous regime possible? That troubling question has occupied many fine minds over the last six decades, few more lucid and thoughtful than the late historian and journalist Sebastian Haffner. In this book, drawn from a manuscript he did not live to complete, Haffner examines the social and cultural conditions that made Germany ill-equipped for democracy and ripe for totalitarianism. Among these, Haffner writes, were a generational war between an apathetic adult population and a youth "familiar with nothing but political clamor, sensation, anarchy, and the dangerous lure of irresponsible numbers games"; a fatal fondness for the winner-and-loser dichotomy of sports and a rage for spectacle and entertainment; a resignation through which ordinary people came to "adapt to living with clenched teeth, in a manner of speaking," rather than stand up in protest. In that climate, Haffner--who left Germany just before World War II broke out--suggests, Nazism was almost an inevitability, against which he, too, tried to withdraw into "a small, secure, private domain," like so many others of his time and place. An important eyewitness account, Haffner's book deepens our understanding of how small missteps can lead to tragic ends, and how nations can be led into chaos. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Sebastian Haffner</b> was born in Berlin in 1907.

Iron Shirt Chi Kung is the martial aspect of the Universal Tao system. It develops internal power and structure and a well-conditioned body through simple techniques that build and store Chi. The body becomes open and relaxed. The joints are strengthened, the muscles, tendons and ligaments become soft and strong, and the bones and bone marrow become strong and healthy. Iron Shirt Chi Kung helps us to become rooted to the earth, thereby keeping our body centered and balanced. In the long run, Iron Shirt offers a way of perfecting our inner selves, allowing us to reach higher spiritual levels. The grounding practice provides a firm rooting for the ascension of the spirit. In the days before gunpowder, Iron Shirt Chi Kung was one of the principle martial arts, which built powerful bodies able to withstand hand to hand combat. Even then, however; martial use was only one aspect of Iron Shirt and today, its other aspects remain vitally significant for anyone seeking better health, a sane mind and spiritual growth. &#34;Iron Shirt&#34; refers to the fact that its unique system of breathing exercises which permanently pack concentrated air into the fascia (connective tissues), surrounding the vital organs, make them close to impervious to injuries from accidents or blows. We also learn how to root ourselves in the Earth&#39;s ower and thus how to direct the Earth&#39;s gravitational and healing power through our bone structure. Iron Shirt&#39;s strengthening of the organs is of special interest to athletes and performers, for it teaches them how to increase the performance of the organs during sports, speech, singing, dancing and playing music. For the Taoist masters, all this in turn lays the groundwork for higher spiritual work. Every step of the way is made clear in the numerous line illustrations by Juan Li.</p><p></p><h2>When You Look Like Your Passport Photo, It&#39;s Time to Go Home</h2><p>America&#39;s favorite housewife takes a witty look at family vacations, describing her escapades in Istanbul, the Galapagos Islands, and other locales</p><p>Erma Bombeck, one of the most popular newspaper columnists in the United States and the author of numerous bestselling books, died in San Francisco on Monday, April 22, 1996 from complications following a kidney transplant earlier in the month.<p>Bombeck had been ill for some time. In 1992, after she underwent a mastectomy, her kidneys failed and she began dialysis at her home in Arizona. She suffered from polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary complaint. Even with her illness, Bombeck continued her weekly schedule of housework, her source for the hilarious columns and books for which she was widely loved.</p><p>"My type of humor is almost pure identification," she once told <em>The New York Times</em>. "A housewife reads my columns and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!'</p><p>"If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it. I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."</p><p>Erma Bombeck's books include <em>Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession</em>, which spent an entire year in the Number One spot on <em>The New York Times</em> bestseller list; <em>Family: The Ties That Bind...and Gag!</em>; <em>If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?</em>; <em>I Want to Grow Hair, I Want to Grow Up, I Want to Go to Boise</em>; <em>When You Look Like Your Passport Photo, It's Time to Go Home</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and the sixth biggest selling nonfiction book of 1991; and <em>A Marriage Made in Heaven...Or Too Tired for an Affair.</em></p><p>There are over twenty million copies of Erma shelved, and her thrice-weekly syndicated columns reached an estimated thirty million readers every week.</p><p>Bombeck was a regular on ABC-TV's <em>Good Morning America</em> for eleven years.

Huddled in a lumpy bed in Papua New Guinea, listening to a tribal war play itself out in the street outside her hotel room, Bombeck reflects on the privileges earned by a life of hard work, prudent financial management, and a taste for adventure. Over the years, not only have she and her husband (as well as, at the worst of times, her three reluctant adolescent kids) been blessed with the chance to drag 50-pound suitcases from airport terminal to taxi queue to hotel lobby to hotel room and back again (or else, when the luggage is lost in transit, to spend two weeks in Tahiti in three-piece suits), but they have splurged on bus tours that allotted 15 minutes to view the Book of Kells in Ireland and an hour and a half to tour a sweater factory; on a private car whose driver spoke English like an Italian Henry Kissinger with a lip full of Novocain; on a villa in which the staff spoke only Spanish and the guests were reduced to rubbing their tummies at the cook and saying, ``Yummy, yummy!''; and on a glamorous cruise through the fjords of Norway, where Bombeck and spouse ate 17 meals a day and outgrew their clothes, only to find half the crew camped out in the exercise room. Worldly wisdom gained by years of experience with Turkish bathrooms, Montezuma's revenge, and transporting native spears home on American airlines has impressed on Bombeck the basic commonality of all cultures and has inspired her to suggest that instead of stockpiling nuclear weapons we should aim our vacation slides at one another. Classic Bombeck, in which she does away with any notion of an empty-nest syndrome. (Literary Guild Dual Selection for August.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is an icon, maybe the icon, of the 20th century. He was a failed artist with Wagnerian fantasies, a slob who could not get up in the morning, but he exposed the frailties of modern civilisation in a way that should still make us giddy. How? Was it his doing, or German society&#39;s? Professor Ian Kershaw has produced a work of definitive scholarship that will be the standard for years to come. It was badly needed; since Alan Bullock&#39;s 1952 classic Hitler: A Study in Tyranny and Joachim Fest&#39;s Hitler (originally published in 1973) there has been much valuable research, all of which Kershaw seems to have read (there are 200 pages of notes). Add to this the media (and, by extension, public) fascination with the nature of evil, and a resurgent interest in right-wing groups, and this book becomes long overdue. Kershaw deals rigorously with the bones of his subject&#39;s life. He has no truck with psychological padding, and calmly demolishes most of the quasi-facts that have sprung up--if in doubt, he allows space within the chronology. His description of the path to the Chancellorship, which was always more messy than messianic, is painful to behold but gripping to follow, and concludes in 1936 with Hitler at the height of his &#34;Hubris&#34;. This is an important study of the character of power, as clearly written as it is intellectually engaging.</p><p><p>Front Flap<br>&nbsp;In this now classic account, Ian Kershaw takes an innovative approach to the Hitler story. By putting forward the idea of Hitler as a 'charismatic leader'&nbsp;Kershaw tries to find answers to the questions of why Hitler of all the nationalist-racist fanatics with roughly similar views in Germany after the First World War should find such appeal, how such an unlikely figure as Hitler could come to wield such extraordinary personalised power, what his personal role in the shaping of policy amounted to, and whether he was indeed personally directing policy and taking the key decisions down to the very end.&nbsp;Hitler is portayed by Kershaw as a social product, not a demonic figure. He is depicted as the product of a society at a particular conjuncture - a society gripped by an extraordinary and comprehensive crisis of values, an overwhelming cultural as well as political, social and economic crisis. In the fourteen years that follwed the end of the First World War, he gradually emerged as the mouthpiece of the nationalist masses and&nbsp;eventually transformed himself into what over thirteen million Germans saw as the hope of national salvation.&nbsp;Ian Kershaw&nbsp;offers original insights into&nbsp;how Hitler 'became possible' and paints a compelling portrait of dictatorial power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Back Flap<br><br><b>Ian Kershaw</b> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield.

Reprint.</p><p>Pratchett (of Discworld fame) and Gaiman (of Sandman fame) may seem an unlikely combination, but the topic (Armageddon) of this fast-paced novel is old hat to both. Pratchett&#39;s wackiness collaborates with Gaiman&#39;s morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again. You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale. Like top agents everywhere, they&#39;ve long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in. The only person who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read the first time, and the second time, and the third time..."A Superbly funny book.

Serious people, some of whom write short stories, learn to mistrust and even to revile it. The word wears spandex, pasties, a leisure suit studded with blinking lights. It gives off a whiff of Coppertone and dripping Creamsicle, the fake-butter miasma of a movie- house lobby, of karaoke and Jagermeister, Jerry Bruckheimer movies, a Street Fighter machine grunting solipsistically in the corner of an ice-rink arcade, bread and circuses, the Weekly World News. Entertainment trades in clich� and product placement. It sells action figures and denture adhesive. It engages regions of the brain far from the centers of discernment, critical thinking, ontological speculation. It skirts the black heart of life and drowns life&#x2019;s lambency in a halogen glare. Intelligent people must keep a certain distance from its productions. They must handle the things that entertain them with gloves of irony and postmodern tongs. Entertainment, in short, means junk, and too much junk is bad for you bad for your heart, your arteries, your mind, your soul.<br> But maybe these intelligent and serious people, my faithful straw men, are wrong. Maybe the reason for the junkiness of so much of what pretends to entertain us is that we have accepted indeed, we have helped to articulate such a narrow, debased concept of entertainment. The brain is an organ of entertainment, sensitive at any depth and over a wide spectrum. But we have learned to mistrust and despise our human aptitude for being entertained, and in that sense we get the entertainment we deserve.<br> I&#x2019;d like to believe that, because I read for entertainment, and I write to entertain. Period. Oh, I could decoct a brew of other, more impressive motivations and explanations. I could uncork some stuff about reader response theory, or the Lacanian parole. I could go on God knows I&#x2019;ve done it elsewhere about the storytelling impulse and the need to make sense of experience through story. A spritz of Jung might scent the air. I could adduce Kafka&#x2019;s formula, as the brilliant Lorrie Moore did in this space last year, of a book as an axe for the frozen sea within. I could go down to the caf� at the local mega-bookstore and take some wise words of Abelard or Koestler, about the power of literature, off a mug. But in the end here&#x2019;s my point it would still all boil down to entertainment, and its suave henchman, pleasure. Because when the axe bites the ice, you feel an answering throb of delight all the way from your hands to your shoulders, and the blade tolls like a bell for miles.<br> Therefore I would like to propose expanding our definition of entertainment to encompass everything pleasurable that arises from the encounter of an attentive mind with a page of literature. In so doing I will only be codifying what has, all my life, been my operating definition.<br> Here is a sample, chosen at random from my career as a reader, of encounters that would be covered under my new definition of entertainment: the engagement of the interior ear by the rhythm and pitch of an original prose style; the dawning awareness that giant mutant rat people dwell in the walls of a ruined abbey in England; two hours spent bushwhacking through a densely packed argument about the structures of power as embodied in nineteenth-century prison architecture; the consummation of a great love aboard a lost Amazonian riverboat or in Elizabethan slang; the intricate fractal patterning of motif and metaphor in Nabokov and Neil Gaiman; stories of pirates, zeppelins, sinister children; a thousand-word-long sentence comparing homosexuals to the Jews in a page of Proust; a duel to the death with broadswords on the seacoast of ancient Zingara; the outrageousness of whale slaughter or mule slaughter in Melville or Cormac McCarthy; the outrageousness of Dr. Charles Bovary&#x2019;s clubfoot- correcting device; the outrageousness of outrage in a page of Philip Roth; words written in smoke across the London sky on a day in June 1923; a momentary gain in my own sense of shared despair, shared nullity, shared rapture, shared loneliness, shared brokenhearted glee; the recounting of a portentous birth, a disastrous wedding, or a midnight deathwatch on the Neva.<br> The original sense of the word entertainment is a lovely one of mutual support through intertwining, like a pair of trees grown together, each sustaining and bearing up the other. It suggests a kind of midair transfer of strength, contact across a void, like the tangling of cable and steel between two lonely bridgeheads. I can&#x2019;t think of a better approximation of the relation between reader and writer. Derived senses of fruitful exchange, of reciprocal sustenance, of welcome offered, oof grasp and interrelationship, of a slender span of bilateral attention along which things are given and received, still animate ttttthe word in its verb form: we entertain visitors, guests, ideas, prospects, theories, doubts, and grudges.<br> At some point, inevitably, as generations of hosts entertained generations of guests with banquets and feasts and displays of artifice, the idea of pleasure seeped into the pores of the word. And along with pleasure (just as inevitably, I suppose) came disapproval, a sense of hollowness and hangover, the saturnine doubtfulness that attaches to delight and artifice and show to pleasure, that ambiguous gift. It&#x2019;s partly the doubtfulness of pleasure that taints the name of entertainment. Pleasure is unreliable and transient. Pleasure is Lucy with the football. It is the roguish boyfriend who upends your heart with promises, touches you for twenty bucks, and then blows town. Pleasure is easily synthesized, mass-produced, individually wrapped. Its benefits do not endure, and so we come to mistrust them, or our taste for them.<br> The other taint is that of passivity. At some point in its history, the idea of entertainment lost its sense of mutuality, of exchange. One either entertains or is entertained, is the actor or the fan. As with all one-way relationships, grave imbalances accrue. The entertainer balloons with a dangerous need for approval, validation, love, and box office; while the one entertained sinks into a passive spectactorship, vacantly munching great big salty handfuls right from the foil bag. We can&#x2019;t take pleasure in a work of art, not in good conscience, without accepting the implicit intention of the artist to please us. But somewhere along the course of the past century or so, as the great machinery of pleasure came online, turning out products that, however pleasurable, suffer increasingly from the ills of mass manufacture spurious innovation, inferior materials, alienated labor, and an excess of market research that intention came to seem suspect, unworthy, and somehow cold and hungry at its core, like the eyes of a brilliant comedian. Lunch counters, muffler shops, dinner theaters, they aim to please; but writers? No self-respecting literary genius, even an occasional maker of avowed entertainments like Graham Greene, would ever describe himself as primarily an entertainer.&#x201d; An entertainer is a man in a sequined dinner jacket, singing She&#x2019;s a Lady&#x201d; to a hall filled with women rubber-banding their underpants up onto the stage.<br> Yet entertainment as I define it, pleasure and all remains the only sure means we have of bridging, or at least of feeling as if we have bridged, the gulf of consciousness that separates each of us from everybody else. The best response to those who would cheapen and exploit it is not to disparage or repudiate but to reclaim entertainment as a job fit for artists and for audiences, a two-way exchange of attention, experience, and the universal hunger for connection. The short story maps the most efficient path for spanning the chasm between two human skulls. Cartographers employ different types of maps political, topographic, dot to emphasize different kinds of information. These different types are complementary; taken together they increase our understanding. In other introductions to other collections of short stories, I have argued for the commonsense proposition that, in constructing our fictional maps, we ought not to restrict ourselves to one type or category. Science fiction, fantasy, crime fiction all these genres and others have rich traditions in the American short story, reaching straight back to Poe and Hawthorne, our first great practitioners of the form. One of the pioneers of the modern psychological&#x201d; short story as we now generally understand it, Henry James, wrote so many out-and-out ghost stories that they fill an entire book. But the same process of commercialization and mass appeal that discredited entertainment, or the idea of literature as entertainment, also devastated our notion of the kinds of short stories that belong in college syllabi, prestigious magazines, or yearly anthologies of the best American short stories (another victory, in my view, for the enemies of pleasure, in their corporate or ivory towers). In spite of this general neglect by the literary mainstream, however, those other traditional genres remain viable and lively and powerful models of the short story, whether in the hands of a daring soul like Kelly Link or those of a crime novelist, like Dennis Lehane, who takes a brilliant chance on the form that brought us some of the best work that Hammett and Chandler ever did.<br> I guess that in the end all this talk of pleasure and entertainment is by way of acknowledging the obvious: I have no idea if these are the twenty best short stories published in the United States during 2004, or not. And neither do you. Or rather, you may feel very strongly that they are not, or that some of the stories here deserve the honor and some don&#x2019;t. But as you make your assessment as you judge the product of my judgment you will be relying, whether consciously, unconsciously, or in full-blown denial, on the same fundamental criterion as that on which I relied: the degree to which each of these stories catches hold of you, banishes everything but the interplay of your imagination and the author&#x2019;s, your ear and the author&#x2019;s, your solitude and the author&#x2019;s. That&#x2019;s entertainment. Short stories entertain; they aim to please. These are the twenty stories that pleased me best.<br><br> Copyright � 2005 by Houghton Mifflin.

Songs like "Take Me Home, Country Roads," "Rocky Mountain High," and "Annie's Song" have entered the canon of universal anthems, but less than three decades ago, John Denver was a young man with little more than a fine voice, a guitar, and a dream. Growing up in a conservative military family, he was not expected to drop out of college and head to Los Angeles, where the music scene was flourishing. Nor was he expected to succeed.<br>In Take Me Home, John Denver chronicles the experiences that shaped his life, while unraveling the rich, inner journey of a shy Midwestern boy whose uneasy partnership with fame has been one of the defining forces of his first fifty years.<br>With candor and wit, John writes about his childhood, the experience of hitting L.A. as the Sixties roared into full swing, his first breaks, his years with the Mitchell Trio, his first songwriting success with "Leaving on a Jet Plane," and finally a career that made his a global household name.<br>He also explores his relationships with the women in his life - particularly his first wife, Annie Martell, and his second wife, Cassandra Delaney - as well as his parents, his children, his partners through his life, and his friends.<br>Honest, insightful and rich in anecdotes that only a natural-born storyteller could tell so well, Take Me Home is a highly charged and fascinating book from beginning to end. It's like spending a couple of days with a good friend.</p><p>With more than 33 million records sold and seven Billboard Top Ten albums, Denver released 23 studio albums over his lifetime. Best known for the beloved songs "Leaving On a Jet Plane," "Sunshine On My Shoulders," "Annie&#x2019;s Song," "Rocky Mountain High," which is a co-state song of Colorado, and "Take Me Home, Country Roads," which is a co-state song of West Virginia. In addition to his numerous awards and recognitions, Denver was instrumental in championing environmental and humanitarian causes. His popularity and continuing influence on popular culture still grow more than a decade after his untimely death. Denver was a true adventurer, exploring all that the world had to offer. Throughout his life&#x2019;s journey he challenged himself on every level, which is an integral part of what made him an extraordinary man, an uncommon friend and a rare human being. While the frontiers of the American West satisfied his spirit, less-traveled frontiers appealed to his imagination. Denver was an experienced airplane pilot and collected vintage biplanes. His interest in outer space was so great that he took and passed NASA&#x2019;s examination to determine mental and physical fitness needed for space travel. He then became a leading candidate to be the &#x201c;first civilian in space&#x201d; on the Space Shuttle Challenger. Denver planned to write a song in space, but circumstances kept him from joining the ill-fated expedition, which saddened the world when it exploded during take-off in 1986. Many of Denver&#x2019;s songs reflected his relationship with nature and indeed, one of his greatest pleasures was spending time outdoors. He spent as much time as possible backpacking, hiking, climbing and fishing. He was an avid golfer and skier, regularly participating in celebrity charity events for both sports. Today, millions of fans old and new enjoy the work of this extraordinary performer. Thirty albums and four decades after he began, John Denver&#x2019;s music is as relevant as ever. His humanitarian work continues to strengthen our global village, and his dynamic celebration of life, spirit and nature is a powerful inspiration to us all. To learn more about the legacy of John Denver please visit his website: www.johndenver.com.Boy, talk about looks being deceiving. The smiling, bespectacled singer-songwriter who gave us such good-time hits as "Sunshine on My Shoulders" and "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" is actually an awkward, insecure loner fighting the demons of his relationships with his father, his wife, and his agent, to name three. Denver, who was born Henry John Deutschendorf, an air force brat, had a Great Santini-like relationship with his father and apparently a very unhappy childhood, during which he saw injustices done to those weaker than himself but felt powerless to stop it. Although he does mention how he came to write some of his biggest hits, including "Leaving on a Jet Plane," "Annie's Song," and "Take Me Home, Country Roads," fans will be disappointed that he doesn't expand more on the songwriting. Denver also feels strongly about environmental issues, but entertainment buffs may feel a little slighted by just passing references to personalities like David Crosby and Harry Chapin and the virtual nonexistence of the singer's biggest film role, namely, that opposite George Burns in <i>Oh God!</i> In other words, forget about a music biz tell-all; Denver chooses, instead, to exorcise his psychological demons throughout, and although it's kind of interesting, it's far from far-out. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>The Bronze Bow</h2><p>Set in Galilee in the time of Jesus, this is the story of a young Jewish rebel who is won over to the gentle teachings of Jesus.</p><p>&#34;I was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, on November 21, 1908. I have lived all my life in New England, and though I love to travel I can&#39;t imagine ever calling any other place on earth home. Since I can&#39;t remember a time when I didn&#39;t intend to write, it is hard to explain why I took so long getting around to it in earnest. But the years seemed to go by very quickly. In 1936 I married Alden Speare and came to Connecticut. Not till both children were in junior high did I find time at last to sit down quietly with a pencil and paper. I turned naturally to the things which had filled my days and thoughts and began to write magazine articles about family living. Then one day I stumbled on a true story from New England history with a character who seemed to me an ideal heroine. Though I had my first historical novel almost by accident it soon proved to be an absorbing hobby.&#34; Elizabeth George Speare (1908-1994) won the 1959 Newbery Medal for THE WITCH OF BLACKBIRD POND, and the 1962 Newbery Medal for THE BRONZE BOW. She also received a Newbery Honor Award in 1983, and in 1989 she was presented with the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for her substantial and enduring contribution to children&#39;s literature."A moving, vivid, and well-written picture of the spiritual vs. the material, vengeance vs. love."

It includes &#34;Requiem&#34;, her poem of the Stalinist Terror and &#34;Poem Without a Hero&#34;.</p><p>This volume presents the largest selection of Anna Akhmatova's poetry yet available in English. It includes many poems translated for the first time, and it covers the whole of her career, from the love lyrics and songs which made her famous in the teens of the twentieth century to the long poems which many critics regard as her most lasting achievements. <p> Akhmatova, along with her contemporaries Mandelstam, Pasternak, and Tsvetaeva formed a "poetic quartet" which many Russian readers think of as the finest representatives of poetry for the last 100 years. They began their careers almost simultaneously, just before World War I. Tsvetaeva would hang herself in 1941, Mandelstam die in terrible Kolyma in 1938. Akhmatova and Pasternak lived out their lives, though not without serious problems from officialdom--Pasternak being railroaded out of the Union of Soviet Writers for winning the Nobel Prize, Akhmatova almost never being published and often being attacked as an "inner emigre," a "bourgeois" a "slut," and so on. Her long poem Requiem, given here in Robin Kemball's translation, was an expression of the vast grief felt by all those Russian women whose loved ones were ground up by GULAG, including Akhmatova's son Lev (her son by Nikolai Gumilev, the Acmeist poet shot to death by the Cheka in 1921). </p><p> The other long poem presented here, <i>A Poem without a Hero</i>, is a profound historical and literary meditation on the passing of the whole Silver Age of Russian culture. This poem is highly allusive, so the detailed commentaries provided by Carl R. Proffer are not just useful, but necessary. </p><p> But it is Akhmatova's early poems which have had the widest and most loving audience. As Walter Arndt writes in his Introduction: "Among the remaining witnesses of the 20th century's 'remarkable decade' in Russian poetry, 1912-1922, many still speak with animation and awe of the change of air in poetry which was heralded by <i>Evening</i>, Akhmatova's first volume of verse. It was placed beyond doubt two years later by her second, <i>Rosary</i>: a delicate but decisive discharge of lyric directness, authenticity of feeling, palpability of image and phrase." This new collection represents the early period richly. </p><p> In addition to the editor's introduction "The Akhmatova Phenomenon," there is a Chronology of the poet's fife. For students who may want to compare the translations to the originals, the Table of Contents provides a key of titles and first fines to the most easily available Russian edition. </p><p> Walter Arndt is Professor of Russian Literature at Dartmouth. His translation of Pushkin's <i>Eugene Onegin</i> won the Bollingen Prize. He is also translator of <i>Pushkin Threefold</i> and Pushkin's <i>Ruslan and Liudmila.</i></p><p>Anna Akhmatova (1889&#x2013;1966), the literary pseudonym of Anna Andreevna Gorenko, became famous after the publication of her second book of poems, <b>Beads</b>.</p> <br><p>D.

I&#x2019;m a health psychologist, and through all my training in psychology and medicine, I got one message loud and clear: Stress is toxic.</p><p>For years, as I taught classes and workshops, conducted research, and wrote articles and books, I took that message and ran with it. I told people that stress makes you sick; that it increases your risk of everything from the common cold to heart disease, depression, and addiction; and that it kills brain cells, damages your DNA, and makes you age faster. In media outlets ranging from the<i> Washington Post</i> to <i>Martha Stewart Weddings</i>, I gave the kind of stress-reduction advice you&#x2019;ve probably heard a thousand times. Practice deep breathing, get more sleep, manage your time. And, of course, do whatever you can to reduce the stress in your life.</p><p>I turned stress into the enemy, and I wasn&#x2019;t alone. I was just one of many psychologists, doctors, and scientists crusading against stress. Like them, I believed that it was a dangerous epidemic that had to be stopped.</p><p>But I&#x2019;ve changed my mind about stress, and now I want to change yours.</p><p>Let me start by telling you about the shocking scientific finding that first made me rethink stress. In 1998, thirty thousand adults in the United States were asked how much stress they had experienced in the past year. They were also asked, Do you believe stress is harmful to your health?</p><p>Eight years later, the researchers scoured public records to find out who among the thirty thousand participants had died. Let me deliver the bad news first. High levels of stress increased the risk of dying by 43 percent. But&#x2014;and this is what got my attention&#x2014;that increased risk applied only to people who also believed that stress was harming their health. People who reported high levels of stress but who did not view their stress as harmful were not more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of death of anyone in the study, even lower than those who reported experiencing very little stress.</p><p>The researchers concluded that it wasn&#x2019;t stress alone that was killing people. It was the combination of stress and the <i>belief </i>that stress is harmful. The researchers estimated that over the eight years they conducted their study, 182,000 Americans may have died prematurely because they believed that stress was harming their health.</p><p>That number stopped me in my tracks. We&#x2019;re talking over twenty thousand deaths a year! According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that would make &#x201c;believing stress is bad for you&#x201d; the fifteenth-leading cause of death in the United States, killing more people than skin cancer, HIV/AIDS, and homicide.</p><p>As you can imagine, this finding unnerved me. Here I was, spending all this time and energy convincing people that stress was bad for their health. I had completely taken for granted that this message&#x2014;and my work&#x2014;was helping people. But what if it wasn&#x2019;t? Even if the techniques I was teaching for stress reduction&#x2014;such as physical exercise, meditation, and social connection&#x2014;were truly helpful, was I undermining their benefit by delivering them alongside the message that stress is toxic? Was it possible that in the name of stress management, I had been doing more harm than good?</p><p>I admit, I was tempted to pretend that I never saw that study. After all, it was just one study&#x2014;and a correlational study at that! The researchers had looked at a wide range of factors that might explain the finding, including gender, race, ethnicity, age, education, income, work status, marital status, smoking, physical activity, chronic health condition, and health insurance. None of these things explained why stress beliefs interacted with stress levels to predict mortality. However, the researchers hadn&#x2019;t actually manipulated people&#x2019;s beliefs about stress, so they couldn&#x2019;t be sure that it <i>was</i> people&#x2019;s beliefs that were killing them. Was it possible that people who believe that their stress is harmful have a different kind of stress in their lives&#x2014;one that is, somehow, more toxic? Or perhaps they have personalities that make them particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of stress.</p><p>And yet, I couldn&#x2019;t get the study out of my head. In the midst of my self-doubt, I also sensed an opportunity. I&#x2019;d always told my psychology students at Stanford University that the most exciting kind of scientific finding is one that challenges how you think about yourself and the world. But then I found the tables were turned. Was I ready to have my own beliefs challenged?</p><p>The finding I had stumbled across&#x2014;that stress is harmful only when you believe it is&#x2014;offered me an opportunity to rethink what I was teaching. Even more, it was an invitation to rethink my own relationship to stress. Would I seize it? Or would I file away the paper and continue to crusade against stress?</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>TWO THINGS in my training as a health psychologist made me open to the idea that how you think about stress matters&#x2014;and to the possibility that telling people &#x201c;Stress will kill you!&#x201d; could have unintended consequences.</p><p>First, I was already aware that some beliefs can influence longevity. For example, people with a positive attitude about aging live longer than those who hold negative stereotypes about getting older. One classic study by researchers at Yale University followed middle-aged adults for twenty years. Those who had a positive view of aging in midlife lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those who had a negative view. To put that number in perspective, consider this: Many things we regard as obvious and important protective factors, such as exercising regularly, not smoking, and maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, have been shown, on average, to add less than four years to one&#x2019;s life span.</p><p>Another example of a belief with long-reaching impact has to do with trust. Those who believe that most people can be trusted tend to live longer. In a fifteen-year study by Duke University researchers, 60 percent of adults over the age of fifty-five who viewed others as trustworthy were still alive at the end of the study. In contrast, 60 percent of those with a more cynical view on human nature had died.</p><p>Findings like these had already convinced me that when it comes to health and longevity, some beliefs matter. But what I didn&#x2019;t know yet was whether how you think about stress was one of them.</p><p>The second thing that made me willing to admit I might be wrong about stress was what I know about the history of health promotion. If telling people that stress is killing them is a bad strategy for public health, it wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time a popular health promotion strategy backfired. Some of the most commonly used strategies to encourage healthy behavior have been found to do exactly the opposite of what health professionals hope.</p><p>For example, when I speak with physicians, I sometimes ask them to predict the effects of showing smokers graphic warnings on cigarette packs. In general, they believe that the images will decrease smokers&#x2019; desire for a cigarette and motivate them to quit. But studies show that the warnings often have the reverse effect. The most threatening images (say, a lung cancer patient dying in a hospital bed) actually <i>increase</i> smokers&#x2019; positive attitudes toward smoking. The reason? The images trigger fear, and what better way to calm down than to smoke a cigarette? The doctors assumed that the fear would inspire behavior change, but instead it just motivates a desire to escape feeling bad.</p><p>Another strategy that consistently backfires is shaming people for their unhealthy behaviors. In one study at the University of California, Santa Barbara, overweight women read a <i>New York Times</i> article about how employers are beginning to discriminate against overweight workers. Afterward, instead of vowing to lose weight, the women ate twice as many calories of junk food as overweight women who had read an article on a different workplace issue.</p><p>Fear, stigma, self-criticism, shame&#x2014;all of these are believed, by many health professionals, to be powerfully motivating messages that help people improve their well-being. And yet, when put to the scientific test, these messages push people toward the very behaviors the health professionals hope to change. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve seen the same dynamic play out: Well-intentioned doctors and psychologists convey a message they think will help; instead, the recipients end up overwhelmed, depressed, and driven to self-destructive coping behaviors.</p><p>After I first discovered the study linking beliefs about stress to mortality, I started to pay more attention to how people reacted when I talked about the harmful effects of stress. I noticed that my message was met with the same kind of overwhelming feeling I would expect from medical warnings intended to frighten or shame. When I told exhausted undergraduate students about the negative consequences of stress right before final exam period, the students left the lecture hall more depressed. When I shared scary statistics about stress with caregivers, sometimes there were tears. No matter the audience, nobody ever came up afterward to say, &#x201c;Thank you so much for telling me how toxic my stressful life is. I know I can get rid of the stress, but I&#x2019;d just never thought to do it before!&#x201d;</p><p>I realized that as much as I believed talking about stress was important, how I was doing it might not be helping. Everything I had been taught about stress management started from the assumption that stress is dangerous and that people needed to know this. Once they understood how bad stress was, they would reduce their stress, and this would make them healthier and happier. But now, I wasn&#x2019;t so sure.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>MY CURIOSITY about how your attitude toward stress influences its impact sent me on a search for more evidence. I wanted to know: Does how you think about stress really matter? And if believing that stress is bad <i>is</i> bad for you, what&#x2019;s the alternative? Is there anything good about stress that&#x2019;s worth embracing?</p><p>As I pored over scientific studies and surveys from the past three decades, I looked at the data with an open mind. I found evidence for some of the harmful effects we fear but also for benefits we rarely recognize. I investigated the history of stress, learning more about how psychology and medicine became convinced that it is toxic. I also talked to scientists who are part of a new generation of stress researchers, whose work is redefining our understanding of stress by illuminating its upside. What I learned from these studies, surveys, and conversations truly changed the way I think about stress. The latest science reveals that stress can make you smarter, stronger, and more successful. It helps you learn and grow. It can even inspire courage and compassion.</p><p>The new science also shows that changing your mind about stress can make you healthier and happier. How you think about stress affects everything from your cardiovascular health to your ability to find meaning in life. The best way to manage stress isn&#x2019;t to reduce or avoid it, but rather to rethink and even embrace it.</p><p>So, my goal as a health psychologist has changed. I no longer want to help you get rid of your stress&#x2014;I want to make you better at stress. That is the promise of the new science of stress, and the purpose of this book.</p><p>About This Book</p><p>This book is based on a course I teach through Stanford Continuing Studies called the New Science of Stress. The course, which enrolls people of all ages and from all walks of life, is designed to transform the way we think about and live with stress.</p><p>It&#x2019;s helpful to know a little about the science behind embracing stress for two reasons. First, it&#x2019;s fascinating. When the subject is human nature, every study is an opportunity to better understand yourself and those you care about. Second, the science of stress has some real surprises. Certain ideas about stress&#x2014;including the central premise of this book: that stress can be good for you&#x2014;are hard to swallow. Without evidence, it would be easy to dismiss them. Seeing the science behind these ideas can help you consider them and how they might apply to your own experiences.</p><p>The advice in this book isn&#x2019;t based on one shocking study&#x2014;even though that&#x2019;s what inspired me to rethink stress. The strategies you&#x2019;ll learn are based on hundreds of studies and the insights of dozens of scientists I&#x2019;ve spoken with. Skipping the science and getting straight to the advice doesn&#x2019;t work. Knowing what&#x2019;s behind every strategy helps them stick. So this book includes a crash course in the new science of stress and what psychologists call <i>mindsets</i>. You&#x2019;ll be introduced to rising-star researchers and some of their most intriguing studies&#x2014;all in a way that I hope any reader can enjoy. If you have a bigger appetite for scientific details and want even more information, the notes at the end of this book will let you dig deeper.</p><p>But most important, this is a practical guide to getting better at living with stress. Embracing stress can make you feel more empowered in the face of challenges. It can enable you to better use the energy of stress without burning out. It can help you turn stressful experiences into a source of social connection rather than isolation. And finally, it can lead you to new ways of finding meaning in suffering.</p><p>Throughout this book, you&#x2019;ll find two types of practical exercises to try:</p><p>The Rethink Stress exercises in Part 1 are designed to shift your way of thinking about stress. You can use them as writing prompts or as any other forms of self-reflection that work for you. You might think about the topic while you&#x2019;re on the treadmill at the gym or riding the bus to work. You can make it a private reflection or use it to start a conversation. Talk about it with your spouse over dinner or bring it up at your parents&#x2019; group at church. Write a Facebook post about it and ask your friends for their thoughts. Along with helping you think differently about stress in general, these exercises also encourage you to reflect on the role that stress plays in your life, including in relation to your most important goals and values.</p><p>The Transform Stress exercises in Part 2 include on-the-spot strategies to use in moments of stress, as well as self-reflections that will help you cope with specific challenges in your life. They will help you tap into your reserves of energy, strength, and hope when you&#x2019;re feeling anxious, frustrated, angry, or overwhelmed. Transform Stress exercises rely on what I call &#x201c;mindset resets&#x201d;&#x2014;shifts in how you think about the stress you are experiencing in the moment. These mindset resets can alter your physical stress response, change your attitude, and motivate action. In other words, they transform the effect that stress is having on you in the very moment you are feeling stressed. These exercises are based on scientific stu...</p></p><h2>The Adventures Of Tom Bombadil</h2><p>The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and other verses from The Red Book, consist of 16 poems, three about Tom Bombadil himself, one about a hobbit and a troll, two about the Man in the Moon, six which represent simply &#34;adventures&#34;, and four which are in the nature of a bestiary, familiar places to instill the feel of a Middle Earth setting</p><p>J.R.R.Tolkien (1892-1973) was a distinguished academic, though he is best known for writing The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, plus other stories and essays.

In creating them, I became so involved with my characters that their lives were still as much a part of me as I was of them long after the issues in which they appeared became collector's items. Pleased as I was about how I brought the characters and their adventures to life in the pages of the magazines, I still wanted the reader to know more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into fuller-length novels that I published in paperback under other titles. <br>"These particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of great speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that I'm now pleased to collect three of them into book form for the first time. <br>"I hope you enjoy them."<p><b>Louis L'Amour </b>(1908-1988) was an American author whose Western stories are loved the world over. Born in Jamestown, North Dakota, he was the most decorated author in the history of American letters. In 1982 he was the first American author ever to be awarded a Special National Gold Medal by the United States Congress for lifetime literary achievement, and in 1984 President Reagan awarded him the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the nation.

Yotsuba hasn&#39;t gotten much smarter, and her neighbors still haven&#39;t gotten used to this wacky tike&#39;s exploits. A truly heartwarming comedy that will make you laugh out loud!</p><p>Kiyohiko Azuma is the bestselling creator of AZUMANGA DAIOH and the critically acclaimed YOTSUBA&amp;! which won the Excellence Prize in the manga category at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series was also nominated for an Eisner Award in the U.S. in 2008 and has been a regular <i>New York Times </i>bestseller.Yotsuba is an overactive school-age girl of possibly alien origins who's been adopted by a single dad, Koiwai. While this setup has been the launching point for countless adventure manga, Azuma produces something far more rare and charming: an all-ages story about the real world. Yotsuba is incredibly energetic and insatiably curious about the world. Throw in her ignorance about some of the most basic aspects of life and her own off-kilter take on everything, and you have a gentle comedy that goes from slapstick to sly, character-based humor. The supporting cast includes the three sisters who live next door, pretty Asagi, responsible Fuka and patient Ena. There's also Jumbo, Koiwai's towering male friend. Together, this little cast acts out simple but engaging slice-of-life stories. In one, Ena's friend Miura tells Yotsuba that her drawings aren't very good, leading to a crisis over lying and hurt feelings. In a more slapstick tale, Yotsuba draws on her sleeping father's face with marker and then attempts to remove the marks with mayonnaise, making for some sidesplitting visuals. Nothing much happens in <i>Yotsuba&amp;!</i>, but Azuma's bold, sure art handles Yotsuba's emotional range perfectly and creates a sweet world of friendship and discovery. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His books &#34;Noble House&#34; and&#34; Whirlwind&#34; were #1 &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers.Andrew Gavallan, based in Scotland, runs a helicopter company operating in Iran during the Shah's reign. When Khomeini comes to power, Gavallan must get his pilots and their families, and his valuable helicopters, out of the riot-torn country. Complicating matters is his power struggle with his company's secret owner, the Noble House of Hong Kong. The pilots' escape efforts form the basic story but as usual in a Clavell novel the action sweeps across many lives: lovers, spies, fanatics, revolutionaries, friends and betrayers. British, Finnish, American, and Iranian, all are caught up in a deadly religious and political upheaval. Clavell effectively portrays the chilling and bewildering encounters when Westernized lifestyle clashes with harsh ancient traditions. This novel, the fifth in what he calls his Asian Series ( Noble H o use, King Rat, Tai Pan, Shogun ) is certain to be in much demand. A.M.B.

The 20 selections were culled from 6 books published between 1929 and 1967. Each chapter stands on its own, making this a good choice for reading aloud. However, keep in mind that these simple stories were written in a different time and place. For example, in one chapter, Milly-Molly-Mandy and her friend, Billy Blunt, do good deeds to counter a gang of mischievous boys in the town. The misdeeds of the latter include knocking hats off the heads of passersby and leaving gates open. Eventually, they come around and join up with Milly and Billy's group. Although some readers might consider the stories too bland and mundane, Brisley's characters are consistent and likable. Endpapers have a map of Milly-Molly-Mandy's village. Each chapter has one full-page and several smaller black-and-white drawings, reproduced from the originals. A wholesome choice, particularly for children who have outgrown beginner readers.<br><i>Linda L.

The books are an excellent introduction to the <i>Rocks and Minerals</i>, <i>Birds</i>, <i>Wildflowers</i>, and <i>Insects</i> for children aged 8-18. Each guide is appropriately sized to fit in a field vest pocket. Readers who remember previous versions of these field guides from the 1970s that were dull and overly detailed will be pleasantly surprised. These books are arguably the most beautifully photographed and laid out field guides yet published for young people. Each book has an introductory section filled with interesting facts, descriptions of early naturalists, definitions of many of the terms used in the book, and a guide to using the field guide portion of the book. (...)Each field guide features 50 common species with photos and brief descriptions of many more regionally occurring insects. Brief discussions of threatened and endangered species are particularly valuable. Great first guides for children and adults with limited natural history background.<p> The <i>Insect</i> guide has excellent photographs and descriptions of common species. The photographs are very detailed and show the beauty of insects, rather than their gruesome aspects. Good descriptions and warnings regarding poisonous species. <i>--Merri Martz</i></p>Grade 4 Up-Two welcome additions to nature study that are not strictly field guides per se. Beginning with descriptions of ornithology and entomology, the authors invite young people to become aware of and familiar with the natural world. With sharp, clear full-color photos (some spectacular, some disappointingly small), birds and insects are described, classified, and placed in their habitats. Birds covers identification marks; eating, mating, and nesting habits; migration; and endangered status. Insects provides similar information plus cautions against those insects that bite or sting. The photos greatly magnify the size of each species. Both volumes do include useful sections of photos for quick identification while on hikes, etc. A glossary of technical terms, lists for further reading, organizations, videos, software, and Web sites are appended.

His German publisher no longer wants him, his marriage is collapsing, and his house in Austria&#x2014;searched by the police two years earlier&#x2014;no longer feels like home. He&#x2019;s been dreaming of Ostend, the Belgian beach town that is a paradise of promenades, parasols, and old friends. So he journeys there with his lover, Lotte Altmann, and reunites with fellow writer and semi-estranged close friend Joseph Roth, who is himself about to fall in love. For a moment, they create a fragile haven. But as Europe begins to crumble around them, the writers find themselves trapped on vacation, in exile, watching the world burn. In <i>Ostend,</i> Volker Weidermann lyrically recounts &#x201c;the summer before the dark,&#x201d; when a coterie of artists, intellectuals, drunks, revolutionaries, and madmen found themselves in limbo while Europe teetered on the edge of fascism and total war.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Ostend</i> is the true story of two of the twentieth century&#x2019;s great writers, written with a novelist&#x2019;s eye for pacing, chronology, and language&#x2014;a dazzling work of historical nonfiction.<br> &nbsp;<br>(Translated from the German by Carol Brown Janeway)</p><p><b>VOLKER&nbsp; WEIDERMANN,</b> born in Darmstadt in 1969, studied politics and German studies in Heidelberg and Berlin. He began his career as a culture journalist before serving as literary director and editor of the Sunday edition of <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.</i> He is currently a writer and editor covering literature for <i>Der Spiegel</i>. Weidermann received the Kurt Tucholsky Prize for Literary Journalism for <i>Buch der verbrannten B�cher (The Book of Burned Books) </i>and is the author of several works of literary history and critical biography.It&#x2019;s summer up here by the sea; the gaily colored bathing huts glow in the sun. Stefan Zweig is sitting in a loggia on the fourth floor of a white house that faces onto the broad boulevard of Ostend, looking at the water. It&#x2019;s one of his recurrent dreams, being here, writing, gazing out into the emptiness, into summer itself. Right above him, on the next floor up, is his secretary, Lotte Altmann, who is also his lover; she&#x2019;ll be coming down in a moment, bringing the typewriter, and he&#x2019;ll dictate his Buried Candelabrum to her, returning repeatedly to the same sticking point, the place from which he cannot find a way forward. That&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s been for some weeks now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps his great friend Joseph Roth will have some advice. His friend, whom he&#x2019;s going to meet later in the bistro, as he does every afternoon this summer. Or one of the others, one of the detractors, one of the fighters, one of the cynics, one of the drinkers, one of the blowhards, one of the silent onlookers. One of the group that sits downstairs on the boulevard of Ostend, waiting for the moment when they can go back to their homeland. Racking their brains over what they can do to change the world&#x2019;s trajectory so that they can go home to the country they came from, so that in turn they can maybe even come back here to this beach on a visit one day, as guests. For now, they&#x2019;re refugees in vacationland. The apparently ever-cheerful Hermann Kesten, the preacher Egon Erwin Kisch, the bear Willi Muenzenberg, the champagne queen Irmgard Keun, the great swimmer Ernst Toller, the strategist Arthur Koestler: friends, foes, storytellers thrown together here overlooking the beach in July by the vagaries of world politics. And the stories they tell will be the fragments shored against their ruin. <br> &nbsp;<br> Stefan Zweig in the summer of 1936. He looks at the sea through the large window and thinks with a mixture of pity, reticence, and pleasure about the group of displaced men and women he will be rejoining shortly. Until a few years ago, his life had been pure ascent&#x2014;simple, greatly admired, and greatly envied. Now he&#x2019;s afraid, he feels himself bound by a hundred obligations, a hundred invisible fetters. Nothing will loosen them, nothing will provide support. But there is this summer, in which everything might change. Here, on this extravagantly wide boulevard with its magnificent white house and its great casino, the extraordinary Palace of Luck. Holiday mood, lively atmosphere, ice creams, parasols, lethargy, wind, wooden booths.<br><br>&nbsp;###<br><br> He was here once before; it was the summer of 1914, when the disaster began; with the headlines and the newsboys all along the beach promenade screaming more excitedly with every day that passed, excited and joyous because they were doing the best business they&#x2019;d ever had.<br> &nbsp;<br> The majority of the bathers who tore the papers out of their hands were German. The boys yelled the headlines: Russia Provokes Austria; Germany Prepares to Mobilize. And Zweig too&#x2014;pale, well dressed, with wire-rimmed glasses&#x2014;came down by tram to be closer to the unfolding news. He was electrified by the headlines; they made him feel delightfully aroused and excited. Of course he knew that the whole drama would subside into a general silence soon enough, but right now he simply wanted to savor it. The possibility of a great event. The possibility of a war. The possibility of a grand future, of an entire world in motion. His joy was especially great when he looked into the faces of his Belgian friends. They had turned pale in the course of these last days. They were unprepared to join the game and seemed to be taking the whole thing very seriously. Stefan Zweig laughed. He laughed over the pathetic troops of Belgian soldiers on the promenade. Laughed over a little dog that was dragging a machine gun along behind it. Laughed over the entire holy solemnity of his friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> He knew they had nothing to fear. He knew that Belgium as a country was neutral; he knew that Germany and Austria would never overrun a neutral country. &#x201c;You can hang me from this lamppost if the Germans march in here,&#x201d; he cried to his friends. They remained skeptical, and their faces turned grimmer as the days went by.<br> &nbsp;<br> Where had his Belgium gone so suddenly? His supposed land of vitality, of strength, of energy, and the intensity of another kind of life. That was what he so loved about this country and this sea. And why he so admired the country&#x2019;s greatest poet.</p><h2>Israelology: The Missing Link in Systematic Theology</h2><p>One&#39;s view of Israel is key in determining one&#39;s theology. This groundbreaking study investigates four approaches to the theology of Israel Past, Present and Future, and scrutinizes beliefs that tend to confuse the identities of both Israel and the Church. The Biblical Evangelist called Israelology a &#34;tremendous, masterful book... Amillennialism, postmillennialism and other forms of Covenant Theology go up in smoke under the withering blaze of biblical light Fruchtenbaum places on them</p><p>Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum was Born September 26, 1943 in Russia, after his father was released from a Communist prison. Even though he is Jewish, his father was accused of being a Nazi spy when he fled Poland from Hitler. The Fruchtenbaums escaped from behind the Iron Curtain with help from the Israeli underground. They resided in Germany from 1946 to 1951, where Arnold received orthodox Jewish training. The Fruchtenbaums immigrated to Brooklyn in 1951, where they first came in contact with the American Board of Missions to the Jews (now Chosen People Ministries). At age 13, Arnold G. Fruchtenbaum became a believer in the Messiahship of Jesus. Arnold&#39;s father strongly opposed his beliefs, however; he allowed Arnold to continue associating with and learning from other Jewish believers until the family moved to Los Angeles in 1958. Once in Los Angeles, Arnold was forbidden to read the Bible, attend Christian meetings, or have anything to do with Messianic Jewish groups. Arnold, however; continued to maintain contact with Jewish believers and to walk with the Lord as best he could. Upon his graduation from High School, he was informed by his father that he would have to leave home because of his beliefs. In 1962, Arnold began undergraduate education at Shelton College. In 1966 He transferred to and graduated from Cedarville University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hebrew and Greek. He moved to Israel that July, and studied archaeology, ancient history, historical geography, and Hebrew at the American Institute of Holy Land Studies and at the Hebrew University. In September 1967, Arnold enrolled at Dallas Theological Seminary. He also began working as a missionary with the American Board of Missions to the Jews. He graduated in 1971 with a Master of Theology degree. In June 1968, he married Mary Ann Morrow. In 1971, they moved to Israel, settling in Jerusalem. They worked with the local messianic congregation training young Israeli believers for service. His activities for Messiah drew the anger of the religious authorities in Jerusalem, finally forcing them to leave Israel in 1973. For the next two years he was a minister for the American Board of Missions to the Jews, and editor of The Chosen People. In 1976, he joined the staff of The Christian Jew Foundation as Associate Director of the largest Messianic Jewish broadcasting ministry in the world. In the summer of 1976, Arnold, along with others in Jewish missions, discussed the lack of discipleship and intensive biblical and theological training of Jewish believers. The early concepts of Ariel Ministries were born at that time. In December 1977 Ariel Ministries became a reality based on the principles of evangelism and discipleship. Arnold now serves as the director of the ministry. In 1989, Arnold completed his Ph.D. at New York University. He is the author of several books and has contributed articles in a number of books and journals. Frequently in demand as a conference speaker and teacher, he has traveled throughout Europe, Asia, Israel, and the United States, becoming intimately acquainted with the Messianic Jewish movement."Thankfully someone has finally taken the Biblical material on Israel and systematized it... presented it in such a helpful form." -- <i>George Zeller</i><br><br>"This book is a 'must have,' 'must read,' and 'must reference.' " -- <i>Glenn W.

Unsurpassed in its range of illustrations, this magnificent volume covers more than 500 years of architectural styles from Tudor to Post-Modern and includes a wealth of American and British vernacular styles. Everyone from owners of period houses, restorers, and architects to interior designers, do it-yourself homeowners, and all those interested in our building heritage will find this reference indispensable. </p><p> More than 3,000 analytical drawings and historic engravings are included in this updated edition as well as 400 photographs in color and over 1,000 in black and white. These extraordinary images provide a systematic guide to the features appropriate for every part of a building, from the major components such as doors, windows, walls, floors, ceilings, and staircases to the small but important embellishments such as moldings and door hardware. </p><p> At the heart of the book is a chronological treatment of the primary styles and periods of architectural design during the past 500 years. Each chapter begins with an illustrated essay, then looks in turn at individual features, from doors and windows to ironwork and woodwork. The usefulness of this book is further enriched by the inclusion of permanent or semipermanent fixtures such as lighting, kitchen stoves, and floor and wall coverings, as well as strictly architectural details. </p><p> A useful system of quick reference, employing color-coded tabs keyed to each feature, enables the reader to trace how particular features evolved over time. And at the back of the book, separate chapters dealing with vernacular architecture are followed by a glossary and a fully updated directory of suppliers of authentic materials as well as period and reproduction features. For this new edition, a biographical directory of architects and architectural practices has been added. </p><p> Compiled by a team of experts headed by Stephen Calloway and Elizabeth Cromley, <i>The Elements of Style</i> is the first book on architectural styles that is comprehensive, incredibly thorough, and accessible in its presentation of individual details. Equally invaluable for authentic period restoration or simply for saying to your contractor, "I want one like that" -- this definitive resource presents literally thousands of details.</p></p><p>Foreword <p>"For a man's house is his castle:, wrote Sir Edward Coke at the beginning of the 17th century. The phrase has become a cornerstone of the way we think and live. Yet, by a stroke of historic irony, the great lawyer's memorable line was penned at the very time when Inigo Jones was building the first modern house in England, the Queen's House at Greenwich -- that precocious expression of polite taste and perfect monument to a new domestic ideal. From this date on people cared for their houses not merely as strongholds of safety and domestic wealth: they loved them for their architecture. Today we are heirs to a legacy of fine building and to a continuing fascination with the details and stylistic elements which give our houses their character. In Britain, and in the United States too, that interest in old houses has become something of a national obsession. The desire to know and understand the history of our homes has never been stronger. We are, perhaps more than ever before,! aware of the crucial importance of our great architectural traditions and the central position they occupy in what we have come to call our heritage. </p><p>At the heart of this concept of heritage lies our idealized image of the period house, which, great or small, ostentatious or plain, has come to epitomize so many of our notions of civilization. The study of the architectural evolution of the country house in England and the United States, and of urban and village building, has a long and distinguished history. But in recent years, academic interest in the planning, stylistic development and detailing of historic houses has increasingly become linked with the more passionate and practical enthusiasms of the conservation movement. As a result, the houses we live in have become a major concern -- the subject of both a large body of scholarly and investigative endeavor and often intense public discussion and debate. </p><p>One of the foremost defenders of traditional values in design and workmanship, the Prince of Wales, has repeatedly stressed the influential role which fine architecture can play in our everyday existence. As the protagonist of a humane architecture based on human scale and sound techniques and materials, he has championed the idea that good building is not only an index of civilization, but also an important contributory factor in the quality of life which we enjoy. </p><p>Today, those who value the best of the old in our heritage are convinced of its relevance to the new. But there is, it has to be said, a great deal that must be learned or re-learned. In recent decades more modern tendencies have prevailed, and we have come perilously close to losing much of the rich vocabulary and even the grammar which gave our architectural language in previous ages its subtlety and fluent charm. What we need now is a return to visual literacy, an understanding of all the elements and details of the house as they have changed through five centuries. To promote such an understanding, which alone can be the only proper basis for conservation, restoration and sensitive design, is one of the main aims of this book. </p><p>We have sought to create within the compass of a single volume a practical sourcebook for all those who care about our heritage of domestic architecture in Britain and the United States. The vast body of illustrative material that has been drawn together here includes specially commissioned photographs of houses, reproductions of engraved plates from the key architectural publications of each period, and drawings based on a wide variety of archival material, including old photographs and measured drawings (often of buildings now demolished), rare prints and builders' pattern books. The images used to illustrate each chapter have been selected by the individual authors, each of whom has made a particular study of his or her period. For each chapter the chief aim has been to show the development of standard forms but also to illustrate some of the influential high-points of architectural achievement and something of the variety that has always characterized domestic buildings. </p><p>Primarily, The Elements of Style, is intended as a visual and documentary resource for people concerned with the details of houses, whether as owners, conservators, architects, interior decorators or designers. For the student and the interested general reader the book can also be used as a way to trace the history of the British and American house. Between the practical approach and the academic there is no real division of interests: a chief desideratum in each case is sympathy for matters of detail, a belief in the importance of accuracy at the most meticulous level. </p><p>The overall plan of this book is a simple chronological one, period by period, style by style. The main chapters deal with what we may define as polite architecture: that is, buildings which aim, with whatever degree of success, at observing the architectural rules and at being fashionable, or in later periods buildings which conform to nationally prevalent types. Houses which fall outside this rather general definition -- modest country dwellings, traditional structural types in use over a long period, and distinct regional variations on standard forms -- are dealt with separately in chapters devoted to vernacular building. British vernacular is treated separately from the end of the Tudor period: before then the two strands have been combined, for the distinctions between vernacular and polite in that era are so blurred as to be misleading, even meaningless. Under American vernacular, the coverage is of rustic and regional features from Colonial times to the mid-l9th century. Inevitably these chapters are highly selective: given the multiplicity of localized styles, this book can do no more than illustrate some of the highlights of vernacular domestic architecture. </p><p>Similarly, although Britain and the United States are treated separately in the first half of the book, the chapters on Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, the Twenties and Thirties, and the Modern and Beyond Modern styles combine material from both sides of the Atlantic, in order to emphasize the close connections that exist in an age of international influences. This approach has brought about some interesting juxtapositions, such as the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow and the early houses of Frank Lloyd Wright in the United States. </p><p>The Elements of Style is nor a book about great architects: although inevitably their names and works appear among these pages, their stories are told elsewhere, and the interested reader will have no difficulty in tracking down more information. Nor is it a study of grand houses to the exclusion of the more modest. We have chosen to place the greatest emphasis on that category which the 18th-century architect and his builder called the "good middling sort of house"; for in such houses we may discern much of the genius of each age and in full measure those qualities which the first architectural writer in English, Sir Henry Wotton, required of all fine building: "Firmness, Commodity and Delight". </p><p>Stephen Calloway</p><b>Stephen Calloway,</b> general editor and contributor of the Early Georgian and Regency period chapters, is a former curator of paintings at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

For one thing, they share a gold-painted, seventh-floor walk-up apartment with some surprisingly verbal vegetation. And then there's the gingerbread they make. Londoners may find themselves able to take or leave it, but it's very popular in Druh�strana, the far-away (or, according to many sources, non-existent) land of Harriet Lee's early youth. The world's truest lover of the Lee family gingerbread, however, is Harriet's charismatic childhood friend Gretel Kercheval &#x2014;a figure who seems to have had a hand in everything (good or bad) that has happened to Harriet since they met.&nbsp;<br><br>Decades later, when teenaged Perdita sets out to find her mother's long-lost friend, it prompts a new telling of Harriet's story. As the book follows the Lees through encounters with jealousy, ambition, family grudges, work, wealth, and real estate, gingerbread seems to be the one thing that reliably holds a constant value. Endlessly surprising and satisfying, written with Helen Oyeyemi's inimitable style and imagination, it is a true feast for the reader.</p></p><p>Helen Oyeyemi is the author of the story collection <i>What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours</i>, along with five novels&#x2014;most recently <i>Boy, Snow, Bird</i>, which was a finalist for the 2014 Los Angeles Times Book Prize. She received a 2010 Somerset Maugham Award and a 2012 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award. In 2013, she was named one of <i>Granta's</i> Best Young British Novelists.<p>1</p><p>Harriet Lee's gingerbread is not comfort food. There's no nostalgia baked into it, no hearkening back to innocent indulgences and jolly times at nursery. It is not humble, nor is it dusty in the crumb.</p><p>If Harriet is courting you or is worried that you hate her, she'll hand you a battered biscuit tin full of gingerbread, and then she'll back away, nodding and smiling and asking that you return the tin whenever convenient. She doesn't say she hopes you'll enjoy it; you will enjoy it. You may think you don't like gingerbread. Well . . . just try this. If you live low-carb, she can make it with almond or coconut flour, and if you can't have gluten, she'll use buckwheat or millet flour, no problem.</p><p>A gingerbread addict once told Harriet that eating her gingerbread is like eating revenge. "It's like noshing on the actual and anatomical heart of somebody who scarred your beloved and thought they'd got away with it," the gingerbread addict said. "That heart, ground to ash and shot through with darts of heat, salt, spice, and sulfurous syrup, as if honey was measured out, set ablaze, and trickled through the dough along with the liquefied spoon. You are phenomenal. You've ruined my life forever. Thank you."</p><p>"Thank you," said Harriet.</p><p>She makes two kinds-the kind your teeth snap into shards and the kind your teeth sink into. Both are dark and heavy and look like they'll give you a stomachache. So what? Food turns into a mess as soon as you chew it anyway. She sometimes tells people that she learned how to make the gingerbread by watching her mother and that the recipe is a family recipe. This is true, but it's also edited for wholesomeness. Harriet's mother, Margot, is no fan of gingerbread. She stood alone over her mixing bowl and stirred with the clenched fist of a pugilist.</p><p>Bambi-eyed Harriet Araminta Lee seems so different from the gingerbread she makes. If she has an aura, it's pastel-colored. She's thirty-four years old, is always slightly overdressed, and wears hosiery gloves when pulling on her tights so as not to snag them. She has a slight Druh&#x2021;stranian accent that she downplays so as not to get exoticized, and she doesn't like her smile. To be precise, she doesn't like the way her smile photographs as forced. So smiling's out. But she doesn't think she can sustain a sober look without seeming unfriendly, so she frequently switches between two expressions-one she thinks of as Alert and the other she thinks of as Accommodating, though she's the only one who can tell the difference. Since her name is far from uncommon, she's encountered other Harriet Lees, Harriet Leighs, and Harriet Lis. Taken in aggregate, Harriet Leigh/Li/Lee is a hard nut, a pushover, thin-skinned and refreshingly forthright, a hedonist and a disciplinarian. She's met Harriet Lee who is a post office clerk by day and a stand-up comedian at night, and she's met Harriet Li the practicing psychoanalyst. She's met Harriet Lee the Essex princess, Harriet Leigh the naval officer, and Harriet Li the sales assistant so rude that you make a note of her name so as to be able to tell the manager about her. The only thing our Harriet really feels she brings to the Harriet Li/Leigh/Lee brand is a categorical sincerity. Her gingerbread keeps and keeps. It outlasts all daintier gifts. Flowers wilt and shed mottled petals, mold blooms greenish-white on chocolate truffles, and Harriet's gingerbread hunkers down in its tin, no more attractive than the day it arrived, but no more repellent either.</p><p>The gingerbread recipe came down through Harriet's father's side of the family. It was devised by a person who became Harriet Lee's great-great-great-grandmother by saving Harriet's great-great-great-grandfather's life. In their time there was a clemency clause for those about to be publicly executed. Before he made you climb up onto the beam, the hangman took one shot at matchmaking on your behalf. Will any take this dross to wed? or whatever it was they said in those days. Marriage was purgatorial, purifying. All it took was for one member of the crowd to come forward and say that they would handle your rehabilitation. This was rare, but it did happen. And then the two of you were married at once so neither party could think better of it later.</p><p>Many viewed public executions in moral terms, or in quasi-cosmic terms, as a gesture toward some sort of equilibrium. Others approached them as spectacle, but due to the clemency clause, public executions occupied a space in Harriet's great-great-great-grandmother's life not dissimilar to the blind dating and speed dating of today. Plenty of opportunity for a realist who has some idea of what she's looking for. At the past five executions Great-Great-Great-Grandma's gut had told her no. But this time, situated as close to the scaffold as she could get, she found herself standing next to somebody sobbing into a deluxe handkerchief, and she thought it was interesting that the woman kept dabbing her face even though not a tear fell. Great-Great-Great-Grandma also found it interesting that the woman kept making hand signals to the man about to be executed, signals the man returned with authentic tears. The ragged reprobate and the lady in silk. And as his list of offenses was read out, it seemed to her that, while brutality had been a near-unavoidable by-product, the motivation was money. Great-Great-Great-Grandma eyed the lady in silk, who was listening with downcast eyes and her handkerchief held up to conceal what must surely be a smile. Great-Great-Great-Grandma took another look at the ragged reprobate and bade him a silent farewell. She thought it something of a mercy for the gullible to die young, as being too often mistaken breaks the spirit.</p><p>But then, asked for his last words, Great-Great-Great-Grandfather said he'd do it all again. His voice was so shaky he had to repeat himself a few times before anybody understood what he was saying. Could this man be any more terrible at lying? Great-Great-Great-Grandma put in her bid for him.</p><p>Family lore has it that they entertained each other very well, the pragmatist and the man who was almost too gullible to live. One had more patience, and the other had more resolve, and they were about even when it came to daring, so their love established possibilities and impossibilities without keeping score. They settled on caretaking a farm, raised grain crops for the farm's owner, and lived very much at the mercy of a climate that would exhibit dazzling beneficence for three or four years in a row and then suddenly take back all its gifts, parching and flooding and freezing the land or reaching through the soil with a gray hand that strangled growth at the root. The abundance of a good harvest overwhelmed the family with glee and trepidation-it put a bone-cracking temporal pressure on them, like raking in gold that rots. As for the lean years . . . Harriet's great-great-greats shunned both prayer and provocation. They had talked it over, and nature struck them as an entity that was either cruel or mad. Not caring to attempt communication with it, they merely sought not to offend it. They kept having more children, so there were always about fifteen, including the ones on their way in or on their way out. The gingerbread recipe is one of the lean-year recipes, and it stands out because the lean-year recipes are all about minimizing waste and making that which is indigestible just about edible. None of it tastes good save the gingerbread, which is exactly as delicious as it has to be. Blighted rye was the family's food of last resort, and the jeopardy in using it was so great that it made Great-Great-Great-Grandma really think about how to take the edge off. Out came the precious ingredients, the warmth of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger, the best saved for last. After this gingerbread you might sweat, swell, and suffer, shed limbs. Often that didn't happen-often the strenuous sifting of the grain expelled just enough ergot to make this an ordinary meal as opposed to a last meal. But just in case, just in case, gingerbread made the difference between choking down risk and swallowing it gladly.</p><p>That temporary subtraction of fear still gives Harriet's mother goose bumps. It is a veiling of alternatives, a way of making sure you don't reject the choice Mother's made for you. No matter what, you will not starve. She has a hunch that over the years, usage of this recipe has always fallen on the shadow side of things. In her own time, Margot Lee replaced the roulette rye flour with flour from wheat blighted by weather and worm. Nothing that would make anybody sick, just inferior grain that couldn't be sold in the usual way. And Margot never did sell the gingerbread, though it brought her useful things through barter. Information, goodwill, and yes, on at least one occasion, compliance. Gingerbread was all she had to offer in exchange for these things, and all she had to spare.</p><p>When Harriet looks through the recipe, she sees the pragmatist and the ideologue joining hands and smiling tiredly at each other. Her version is baked with all organic ingredients, in a West London kitchen awhir with modern appliances. Everything has changed except the gingerbread, which is both trick and treat. This wouldn't worry Emerson, with his "All things have two handles." Though he does add: "Beware of the wrong one." Harriet can never quite tell which handle she offers her own gingerbread by. She's had even less clarity since her daughter, Perdita, who was born at the end of a week in November when the trees called heads or tails and let their leaves spin like red pennies as they fell. Perdita loves gingerbread and used to plead so sadly and sweetly for more. This after having already polished off a whole tin and in spite of her grandmother telling her, "That's enough for you, Fatty Pigsticks." The nickname wasn't very funny in the first place, and over a period of months it fell out of use as Perdita grew gaunt and feeble.</p><p>When Margot observed that the gingerbread was "doing something" to Perdita, Harriet said it couldn't be the gingerbread; it could be any of a number of foods Perdita ate. Some weeks later, when it was no longer possible to deny that gingerbread was all Perdita ate, Harriet said there must be a tapeworm involved and tried various concoctions and home remedies. Margot elected not to sit through a performance of Death by Gingerbread; the soul-cravings of a six-year-old didn't move her in the slightest. She sought medical opinion, obtained a diagnosis, and made it clear that if Harriet ever fed Perdita gluten again, she'd do her for child abuse. Now Perdita only eats gingerbread in her dreams, as the rye version is the only one for her. She'll probably always be a little bit underweight, and her hair remains gray. It turned that color when she was sick, so now it matches Harriet's and Margot's. Pearl-pale hair and bark-brown skin. From a distance Margot, Harriet, and Perdita Lee look like three grannies. Then you get closer and see their unlined faces.</p><p>Looking back, Harriet is still aghast that</p><p>Perdita kept asking for gingerbread.</p><p>She, Harriet, kept making more.</p><p>Perdita went from asking for more to demanding more, even as her bowels stretched and scrunched up, even as iron was leached from her blood.</p><p>Harriet kept making more.</p><p>Margot has already filed away this episode under a combination of fairly prosaic categories: masochism, celiac disease, and a maniacally obliging mother. But Margot only thinks that that's how things work with Perdita because Perdita is usually quite ordinary around her. Margot wasn't there the time Perdita's dolls started complaining about a story she was reading aloud to them. The dolls asked Perdita how she'd like it if somebody read them the same story seven nights in a row. They asked Perdita if she was trying to drive them crazy. They shouted through their nostrils, like Susie Greene in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Harriet looked up from the essays she'd been marking, let out a startled laugh, and looked over at Perdita, who grinned the jack-o'-lantern grin her mother loves so well. Co-conspiracy began.</p><p>That was ten years ago. Perdita is now almost seventeen, and careful with her words, she speaks them as if setting each sentence in print. She may begin to express delight, or to denounce somebody or other, before stopping mid-sentence, looking around in a slightly dazed way, and finishing with: "Huh . . . it doesn't matter anymore . . ." Harriet has never met anyone quite as preoccupied with ephemerality as her daughter is. She wouldn't change Perdita, but there is peril in these diversions. Harriet watches Perdita in the crush at the school gates and intuits that Perdita is neither liked nor disliked by her classmates; she is merely disregarded. Harriet has heard Perdita ask a question and seen the answer directed at somebody else without a skipped beat, as if the question came from the other girl. Perdita doesn't seem to mind this or to sense that she is in danger of losing her right to corporeality. On the contrary, she purposefully deflects attention. When someone accidentally speaks to her, she just shakes her head. If they still won't take the hint, she'll add, "No, I'm not here," in a gentle way rather than a snippy one.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Perdita auditioned for her school talent show. She spent weeks arranging the notes of G-Dragon's "Black" for optimal flute-playing. Harriet looked up an English translation of the lyrics. The first words were "The color of my heart is black . . ."</p><p>Undaunted by her failure to qualify for the preliminary round of the talent show, Perdita performed the piece for Harriet and Margot one midsummer night, a velvet-clad Titania swaying between lit candelabras. She needed a little percussion, which her mother provided by rapping her knuckles against the tabletop, but otherwise Perdita's was a minimalist rendition of the original, as much silence as it was song. The notes had this aural flash to them . . . it was like glimpsing a swan through reeds. It made no impact when placed alongside the rambunctious charms of her classmates' capoeira routines, comedic rap battles, and inexplicably moving impersonations of Ariana Grande impersonating C line Dion. But when Perdita played her cover song for Margot and Harriet, they called for an encore. Which was, of course, completely out of the question.</p></p><h2>The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control</h2><p>Title: The Marshmallow Test( Mastering Self-Control) Binding: Hardcover Author: WalterMischel Publisher: LittleBrownandCompany</p><p>Walter Mischel holds the Robert Johnston Niven chair as professor of humane letters in psychology at Columbia University.

It is a time when publishing is still largely a private affair&#x2014;a scattered family of small houses here and in Europe&#x2014;a time of gatherings in fabled apartments and conversations that continue long into the night. In this world of dinners, deals, and literary careers, Bowman finds that he fits in perfectly. But despite his success, what eludes him is love. His first marriage goes bad, another fails to happen, and finally he meets a woman who enthralls him&#x2014;before setting him on a course he could never have imagined for himself. <br><br> Romantic and haunting, <i>All That Is</i> explores a life unfolding in a world on the brink of change. It is a dazzling, sometimes devastating labyrinth of love and ambition, a fiercely intimate account of the great shocks and grand pleasures of being alive.&nbsp;<br></p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, April 2013</strong>: By starting the life story of Phillip Bowman in the last days of World War II, Salter sets the tone for the rest of this remarkable book. &#x201c;The outcome of great battles could hinge on resolve,&#x201d; he writes, and Bowman is all about resolve. But beneath the deceptively straightforward coming-of-age and growing-old narrative--boy meets girl, loses girl; meets, loses; meets, loses--lurks the deeply personal story of what it meant to be a 20th century man. Bowman is the archetype of the flawed, ambitious, lust-filled American male. He&#x2019;s Don Draper. He&#x2019;s Rabbit Angstrom. He&#x2019;s your dad. He&#x2019;s <em>my</em> dad. (Also named Phil; also from New Jersey.) What&#x2019;s truly astounding here is the writing, from a master who happens to be an octogenarian. Salter crafts beautiful sentences. He creates characters, lives, entire <em>worlds</em> in just a page or two. He&#x2019;s also capable of some blushingly evocative sex scenes--again, impressive for a man approaching 90. Profound and lush, this is a book to savor. It&#x2019;s the sweeping story of a complicated, error-filled, fully wrung-out life. A guy&#x2019;s life.

Barraged by the constant advisements and bickerings of Aunt Penelope and Uncle Deva, who live with their nephew in the shimmering Void, Mr g proceeds to create time, space, and matter. Then come stars, planets, animate matter, consciousness, and, finally, intelligent beings with moral dilemmas. Mr g is all powerful but not all knowing and does much of his invention by trial and error.<br><br>Even the best-laid plans can go awry, and Mr g discovers that with his creation of space and time come some unforeseen consequences&#x2014;especially in the form of the mysterious Belhor, a clever and devious rival. An intellectual equal to Mr g, Belhor delights in provoking him: Belhor demands an explanation for the inexplicable, requests that the newly created intelligent creatures not be subject to rational laws, and maintains the necessity of evil. As Mr g watches his favorite universe grow into maturity, he begins to understand how the act of creation can change himself, the Creator.<br><br>With echoes of Calvino, Rushdie, and Saramago, combining science, theology, and moral philosophy, <i>Mr g</i> is a stunningly imaginative work that celebrates the tragic and joyous nature of existence on the grandest possible scale.</p></p><p><p><b>Alan Lightman</b> is the author of five previous novels, a book-length narrative poem, two collections of essays, and several books on science.

As a matter of fact, time didn&#x2019;t exist. Nor space. When you looked out into the Void, you were really looking at nothing more than your own thought. And if you tried to picture wind or stars or water, you could not give form or texture to your notions.<br>&nbsp;<br>Those things did not exist. Smooth, rough, waxy, sharp, prickly, brittle&#x2014;even qualities such as these lacked meaning. Practically everything slept in an infinite torpor of potentiality. I knew that I could make whatever I wanted. But that was the problem. Unlimited possibilities bring unlimited indecision. When I thought about this particular creation or that, uncertain about how each thing would turn out, I grew anxious and went back to sleep. But at a particular moment, I managed . . . if not exactly to sweep aside my doubts, at least to take a chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Almost immediately, it seemed, my aunt Penelope asked me why I would want to do such a thing. Wasn&#x2019;t I comfortable with the emptiness just as it was? Yes, yes, I said, of course, but . . . You could mess things up, said my aunt. Leave Him alone, said Uncle Deva. Uncle toddled over and stood beside me in his dear way. Please don&#x2019;t tell me what to do, retorted my aunt. Then she turned and stared hard at me. Her hair, uncombed and knotted as usual, drooped down to her bulky shoulders. Well? she said, and waited. I never liked it when Aunt Penelope glowered at me. I think I&#x2019;m going to do it, I finally said. It was the first decision I&#x2019;d made in eons of unmeasured existence, and it felt good to have decided something. Or rather, to have decided that something had to be done, that a change was in the offing. I had chosen to replace nothingness with something. Something is not nothing. Something could be anything. My imagination reeled. From now on, there would be a future, a present, and a past. A past of nothingness, and then a future of something.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact, I had just created time. But unintentionally. It was just that my resolution to act, to make things, to put an end to the unceasing absence of happenings, required time. By deciding to create something, I had pressed an arrow into the shape- less and unending Void, an arrow that pointed in the direction of the future. Henceforth, there would be a before and an after, a continuing stream of successive events, a movement away from the past and towards the future&#x2014;in other words, a journey through time. Time necessarily came before light and dark, matter and energy, even space. Time was my first creation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes, the absence of a thing is not noticed until it is present. With the invention of time, events that had once merged together in one amorphous clot began to take shape. Each event could now be enveloped by a slipcover of time, separating it from all other events. Every motion or thought or the slightest happenstance could be ordered and placed exactly in time. For example, I realized that I had been sleeping for a very long time. And near me&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t say how near, because I had not yet created space&#x2014;Aunt Penelope and Uncle Deva had also been sleeping, their loud snores rising and falling like something or other, their tossings and turnings unfolding in time. And their interminable bickering could now be identified with moments of wakefulness, which in turn could be understood as taking place between periods of sleep. I refused to think how much time I had wasted. In fact, we had all slept in a kind of pleasant amnesia, a swoon, an infinite senselessness. In various ways, had we not luxuriated in the unstructured Void, unaccountable for our actions? Yes, unaccountable. Because without time, there could be no reactions to actions, no consequences. Without time, decisions need not be considered for their implications and effects. We had all been drifting in a comfortable Void without responsibilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>See, my aunt complained when it became apparent that we were now conscious of time. I told you that you would mess things up. She shot Uncle a look of disapproval, as if he had encouraged me to act as I had, and then she began an unhappy summary of the various things that she had done and not done during the immediate past, then during the past before that, and so on, back and back through the now visible chasms of time, until Uncle begged her to stop. You should never have created the past and the future, she said. We were happy here. See, now I must say <i>were</i>, when before . . . Oh! There it is again. It was nicer when everything happened at once. I can&#x2019;t stand to think about the future. But don&#x2019;t you think that we have some responsibility to the future? I suggested. To all the things and beings I might create? Non- sense, shrieked Aunt Penelope. What a foolish argument. You have no responsibility to things that don&#x2019;t yet exist and won&#x2019;t ever exist if you could just keep your big thoughts to yourself. But it&#x2019;s too late now, she went on. I can feel time. I can feel the future. She had gotten herself into one of her states, and the Void twisted and throbbed with her displeasure.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gently, Uncle caressed her. For the first time ever, she responded to his touch. Her ranting diminished. Soon after, she realized that her hair needed combing, and that was the beginning of something and probably all for the best.</p></p><h2>The Tears of Autumn.</h2><p>A re-release of the best-selling thriller originally published twenty years ago finds influential secret agent Paul Christopher pursuing a dangerous theory about the assassination of JFK, an investigation that threatens American foreign policy.

Her memoir Runaway Amish Girl: The Great Escape captivates even the timid reader. Disagreeing with the beliefs of Amish traditions and upbringing, the pressure became too much for her to bear. Forced to make a personal decision, Emma found the courage to leave the only life she had ever known. She had no idea the emotional turmoil she'd inflict on her family and friends. The emotional reaction of her parents, brothers and sisters, are gut wrenching. Considered no longer a daughter and a sister, temporarily exiled, Emma finds a way to be free. Education becomes her priority as she finds her place in this "English" world. This true story is a rare glimpse into the life of a brave young woman - Runaway Amish Girl: The Great Escape.</p></p><p>Emma Gingerich left her Amish community in Eagleville, Missouri, at the age of eighteen. She went to south Texas, close to South Padre Island, where she lived for almost four years. She received her Associates Degree at a community college and transferred to Tarleton State University located in Stephenville, Texas, to complete her Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree. She is currently pursuing her Master&#x2019;s Degree in business administration. Though Emma works full-time as a Billing Coordinator in the healthcare industry and is continuing her college education, she still managed to write her first memoir. She is looking forward to writing a sequel. Education is important to Emma, and she is happy to have the opportunity to attend college. She hopes to help and inspire other Ex-Amish people to receive an education as well. Her passions are: writing, hiking, traveling, running and helping others.<p>This book tells more about the Amish way of life, their so-called dating, what is expected of women, of men and of children, and thoroughly goes into the many reasons this young girl decided she had to get away from the Amish life in order to grow spiritually and go to college. She had no idea what to expect when she left her parents' home and had to be told by other Amish who had escaped, how to live in a world of freedom where she could decide for herself how she wanted to live. She had to be told to shave her legs and underarms, to use deodorant, and that there were guidelines about how to dress even in the "English" world. The reader feels her excitement when she finally gets a truck and learns how to drive it. She also learns that all English are not to be trusted when she is raped and didn't even know what had happened to her. The Amish don't tell their girls anything about sex or life in general, they learn it when they need to know it. Young Amish women are pitifully unprepared for life. I liked this book because the author wasn't afraid to tell the truth. - Jane A.C. Anyone wanting the truth about the strictest of Amish orders needs to read this book. I stayed awake reading till 12:30. Expect to not put the book down once you start. Emma is a very brave girl as well as determined. - Sarah Ayers Heartbreaking, the grief of a human's life without freedom to grow both physically and spiritually. Liked the description of Amish community and it has been the greatest amount of information given. I admire Emma and her courage, her dissatisfaction with their church, determination to be happy and most of all, be able to have peace free from others judgment. Recommend this book and look forward to more of this. - Anna Lozada de Flecha</p><p>Excellent story about a brave woman who decided she wanted more.....and did something about it. Many of the stories of the Amish sugarcoat the stress, especially upon women within the faith. I have lived close to the Amish all my life and although, to the outside (English) world, they appear happy and content, I wonder, sometimes, how many scholars, writers, professionals are canning peaches and green beans and wishing for more freedom.

Elaine Pagels and Karen King are the first to reflect on this newfound text and its ramifications for telling the story of early Christianity. In Reading Judas, the two celebrated scholars illustrate how the newly discovered text provides a window onto understanding how Jesus followers understood his death, why Judas betrayed Jesus, and why God allowed it. <br> <p><br> Most contemporary readers will find passages in the ancient Gospel of Judas difficult to comprehend outside of its context in the ancient world. Reading Judas illuminates the intellectual assumptions behind Jesus teaching to Judas and shows how conflict among the disciples was a tool frequently used by early Christian authors to explore matters of doubt and disagreement. Presented with the elegance, insight, and accessibility that has made Pagels and King the leading voices in this field, this is a book for academics and popular audience both. Pagels's five previous books, including The New York Times bestseller Beyond Belief, and Kings The Gospel of Mary of Magdala prove that there is a considerable audience eager for this kind of informed and engaging writing.</p></p><p><b>Karen L. King</b> is Winn Professor of ecclesiastical history at Harvard Divinity School.<br> <b>Elaine Pagels</b> is Harrington Spear Paine Professor of religion at Princeton University.The historical figure of Judas Iscariot is one of deep paradox--he was one of Jesus's handpicked followers, yet he is also the archetype of betrayal. Elaine Pagels and Karen King are both highly regarded yet unorthodox academics, from Princeton and Harvard, respectively. The professors attempt to recast the fallen disciple using the initial translation of the Judas document recently unveiled by the National Geographic Society. Justine Eyre reads the commentary, and Robertson Dean delivers the Judas material. Both try to create an air of reverence, but it ultimately falls flat under the weight of the dense Gnostic theology. Although audibly agreeable, the content overwhelms all but the most enthusiastic listeners.

They live in a beautiful house, with a caring family, and attend an exclusive missionary school. They're completely shielded from the troubles of the world. Yet, as Kambili reveals in her tender-voiced account, things are less perfect than they appear. Although her Papa is generous and well respected, he is fanatically religious and tyrannical at home&#x2015;a home that is silent and suffocating.<br><br>As the country begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili and Jaja are sent to their aunt, a university professor outside the city, where they discover a life beyond the confines of their father&#x2019;s authority.

When they return home, tensions within the family escalate, and Kambili must find the strength to keep her loved ones together.<br><br><i>Purple Hibiscus</i> is an exquisite novel about the emotional turmoil of adolescence, the powerful bonds of family, and the bright promise of freedom.</p></p><p><i>Purple Hibiscus</i>, Nigerian-born writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's debut, begins like many novels set in regions considered exotic by the western reader: the politics, climate, social customs, and, above all, food of Nigeria (balls of fufu rolled between the fingers, okpa bought from roadside vendors) unfold like the purple hibiscus of the title, rare and fascinating. But within a few pages, these details, however vividly rendered, melt into the background of a larger, more compelling story of a joyless family. Fifteen-year-old Kambili is the dutiful and self-effacing daughter of a rich man, a religious fanatic and domestic tyrant whose public image is of a politically courageous newspaper publisher and philanthropist. No one in Papa's ancestral village, where he is titled "Omelora" (One Who Does For the Community), knows why Kambili�s brother cannot move one of his fingers, nor why her mother keeps losing her pregnancies. When a widowed aunt takes an interest in Kambili, her family begins to unravel and re-form itself in unpredictable ways. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"One of the best novels to come out of Africa in years."--<i>The Baltimore Sun</i><br>"A breathtaking debut. . .[Adichie] is very much the 21st-century daughter of that other great Igbo novelist, Chinua Achebe." - <i>The Washington Post Book World<br><br></i>"The author's straightforward prose captures the tragic riddle of a man who has made an unquestionably positive contribution to the lives of strangers while abandoning the needs of those who are closest to him." - <i>The New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>"At once the portrait of a country and a family, of terrible choices and the tremulous pleasure of an odd, rare purple hibiscus blooming amid a conforming sea of red ones"--<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br><br></i>"Prose as lush as the Nigerian landscape that it powerfully evokes. . . . Adichie's understanding of a young girl's heart is so acute that her story ultimately rises above its setting and makes her little part of Nigeria seem as close and vivid as Eudora Welty's Mississippi." - <i>The Boston Globe<br></i> <br>"Adichie renders this coming-of-age story beautifully.

Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon�, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre. <p> The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Born in London in 1939, Michael Moorcock now lives in Texas.

In those days, the street was a more animated, more colorful place. Jacks and jump rope, hit-the-stick, double-dutch and skelly or potsy (hopscotch to you) were played everywhere. The street was a natural amphitheater, and the stoop was the perfect place for grown-ups to sit and watch and visit with neighbors. Stores-on-wheels selling fruit, baked goods, and the old standby, seltzer, rolled right down the block, and the Fuller Brush man and Electrolux vacuum-cleaner salesmen worked door to door, saving housewives countless shopping trips.<br><br>For many, a big night out was dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where 99 percent of the patrons were non-Chinese, and you could get mysterious-sounding dishes like moo goo gai pan and subgum chow mein -- "One from column A, two from column B."

The end of the era came in 1957 -- the last year that Brooklyn's beloved Dodgers played at Ebbets Field before moving to sunny California.

This book details a type of community plan and management that enables a comprehensive interaction of agriculture with modern society. Agrarian Urbanism may not be for everyone, but it is one of the more beneficial methods to develop and dwell on the land. Because of its mitigating effect on climate change, a neo-agrarian way of life should be made available to as many as possible. If the food-growing machine that is the traditional village were reorganized, it could be made viable again. Historically, most villages were based on food production and distribution as the principal economic and social activity, but today most agricultural landscapes adjacent to towns are valued for additional reasons and protected by government policy to keep them economically viable. As the outline of the 21st century becomes clear, villages are again emerging as practical and desirable. But they will proliferate only if their design and management is handled in a thoroughly modern way to make the lifestyle appealing to more people.

A racing cyclist and launch editor of procycling and <i>Cycle Sport </i>magazines, he has reported on over twenty Tours de France. He is the critically lauded author of <b>Fallen Angel</b><i>, </i><b>Roule Britannia</b>, and <b>Put Me Back on My Bike</b><i>, </i>which <i>V�lo </i>magazine called 'The best cycling biography ever written.Within the world of professional cycling, no name conjures such complete dedication and domination of the sport than that of Eddy &#x201c;the Cannibal&#x201d; Merckx, dubbed for his voracious appetite for winning. Fotheringham expertly traces Merckx&#x2019;s career from his early races in Belgium to his successes at the Tour de France, painting a nuanced portrait of a man best described by his wife as &#x201c;driven on by a power that was unique to him.&#x201d; The power behind this account is Fotheringham&#x2019;s skill in bringing Merckx&#x2019;s races alive on the page. Woven throughout is a thoughtful discussion of the impact of Belgium&#x2019;s ethnic divide between Flemish and French and its affect on Merckx&#x2019;s career, as well as insightful analysis of how Merckx&#x2019;s quiet and introverted personality helped to build his mystique. While Fotheringham clearly holds Merckx in high regard, he avoids the sycophantic tone of many sports biographies by placing Merckx within the wider cycling world at the time. This approach gives a rich depth to the book while still paying tribute to a remarkable athelete. --Eve Gaus</p><h2>Painting What You Want to See</h2><p>If you've ever wanted to control your art so that you can paint anything&#x2014;and paint it well&#x2014;this is the book for you!<br>The mediums are oil, watercolor, and contour drawing but this is a book about making good paintings, not learning a particular medium.

As a sex performer, sexual adventurer, and sex educator, she's done the fieldwork and has taken extensive notes. Now, she's ready to share her research. Let's just say that she's had all the sex-the good, the bad, and the indifferent-so you won't necessarily have to! <br><br> <i>Nina Hartley's Guide to Total Sex</i> is for sexual pioneers and enthusiastic novices. Unabashedly erotic, the book covers a lot of territory, allowing readers to sample the whole smorgasbord or just nibble at what they see as the choicest bits. To start things off, Nina includes explicitly detailed chapters on foreplay, oral sex, masturbation, toys, and games. Sexual adventurers (and voyeurs) will find chapters on swinging, three-ways, anal sex, erotic domination, sensual submission, and much more. <br><br> Nina is a strong advocate of safe sex, physically and emotionally, and she helps readers establish personal ground rules. But as a sexual liberationist and a feminist, her core belief is that, between consenting adults, all sexual behaviors are a matter of personal choice. Whether you're trying to reignite the passion with a longtime spouse, or explore new terrain with a new lover, Nina offers a variety of ideas to achieve exhilarating, deeply satisfying, intimate, and profoundly liberating sex.</p><p>Nina Hartley is a sexual entertainer, activist, educator, and registered nurse, who has starred in hundreds of adult entertainment films and videos, including <i>Boogie Nights</i>. As a "feminist porn star" and sex educator, Nina has taken her positive message to college campuses nationwide. Working with her husband and collaborator, I. S. LEVINE, together they've created a bestselling series of instructional videos.Feminist, registered nurse, sex educator and star of more than 400 adult films, Hartley's sex guide is a thorough, level-headed and straightforward look at all things sexual. Eighteen witty, easy-to-read chapters cover subjects from foreplay and cunnilingus to fellatio, three-ways, domination, toys, bondage and spanking. Each chapter ends with a handy chart reviewing dos and don'ts for the acts explored in detail. Hartley's experienced and capable voice takes the mystery out of sex, viewing all manner of intercourse as healthy activity that often requires more communication and lubrication than partners realize. Intended mainly for heterosexuals and the bi-curious, Hartley and Levine, her husband, emphasize the enlightened female perspective, though advice on technique and position is useful for anyone. Unlike many other sex guides, this one does not include illustrations or photos, which makes it a comfortable choice for more reserved or reticent readers; as Hartley puts it, this is the sex guide "I wish I had owned when I turned eighteen." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And how do we make that hunger productive and vital rather than corrosive and destructive? These are the questions that animate Christian Wiman as he explores the relationships between art and faith, death and fame, heaven and oblivion. Above all, <i>He Held Radical Light</i> is a love letter to poetry, filled with moving, surprising, and sometimes funny encounters with the poets Wiman has known. Seamus Heaney opens a suddenly intimate conversation about faith; Mary Oliver puts half of a dead pigeon in her pocket; A. R. Ammons stands up in front of an audience and refuses to read. <i>He Held Radical Light</i> is as urgent and intense as it is lively and entertaining&#x2015;a sharp sequel to Wiman&#x2019;s earlier memoir, <i>My Bright Abyss</i>.</p></p><p><b>Christian Wiman</b> is the author of several books, including a memoir, <i>My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer</i> (FSG, 2013); <i>Every Riven Thing</i> (FSG, 2010), winner of the Ambassador Book Award in poetry; <i>Once in the West</i> (FSG, 2014), a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist in poetry; and <i>Stolen Air: Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam</i>. He teaches religion and literature at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music and Yale Divinity School.<p>&#x201c;Soul-searing . . . Early on in this book that reads like an unfiltered tete-a-tete, Wiman writes that when he left college, he set out to be a poet who would write &#x2018;a poem that would live forever.&#x2019; He has done that with this magnificent, radiant memoir.&#x201d; <b><i>&#x2015;</i>Barbara Mahany,<i> Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Taut, absorbing . . .

E. B. Du Bois of black Americans in his classic The Souls of Black Folk. A hundred years later, Vijay Prashad asks South Asians "How does it feel to be a solution?" In this kaleidoscopic critique, Prashad looks into the complexities faced by the members of a "model minority"-one, he claims, that is consistently deployed as "a weapon in the war against black America." </p><p>On a vast canvas, The Karma of Brown Folk attacks the two pillars of the "model minority" image, that South Asians are both inherently successful and pliant, and analyzes the ways in which U.S. immigration policy and American Orientalism have perpetuated these stereotypes. Prashad uses irony, humor, razor-sharp criticism, personal reflections, and historical research to challenge the arguments made by Dinesh D'Souza, who heralds South Asian success in the U.S., and to question the quiet accommodation to racism made by many South Asians. A look at Deepak Chopra and others whom Prashad terms "Godmen" shows us how some South Asians exploit the stereotype of inherent spirituality, much to the chagrin of other South Asians. Following the long engagement of American culture with South Asia, Prashad traces India's effect on thinkers like Cotton Mather and Henry David Thoreau, Ravi Shankar's influence on John Coltrane, and such essential issues as race versus caste and the connection between antiracism activism and anticolonial resistance. </p><p>The Karma of Brown Folk locates the birth of the "model minority" myth, placing it firmly in the context of reaction to the struggle for Black Liberation. Prashad reclaims the long history of black and South Asian solidarity, discussing joint struggles in the U.S., the Caribbean, South Africa, and elsewhere, and exposes how these powerful moments of alliance faded from historical memory and were replaced by Indian support for antiblack racism. Ultimately, Prashad writes not just about South Asians in America but about America itself, in the tradition of Tocqueville, Du Bois, Richard Wright, and others. He explores the place of collective struggle and multiracial alliances in the transformation of self and community-in short, how Americans define themselves. </p><p>Vijay Prashad is assistant professor of international studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.</p></p><p>Taking a cue from W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black FolkAwhich poses the question, "How does it feel to be a problem?"APrashad's book on race relations asks Asians, "How does it feel to be a solution?" An assistant professor of international relations, he shows how neoconservatives have used the success of South Asian immigrants (though most of the book deals with Indians) to argue that America now offers a level playing field and that if other minorities, particularly African-Americans, have not achieved as much success, it is due to their own lack of initiative. Yet Prashad demonstrates how the U.S.'s extremely selective immigration policy (from 1966 to 1977, for example, 83% of Indian immigrants to the U.S. were professionals) has led to the myth of the "successful race." In the same vein, Prashad also argues that "sly Babas" (or "Godmen"), like Deepak Chopra, perpetuate the idea that Asians are a pliant, spiritual group and do a disservice by peddling "opiates that comfort" rather than challenging people to alter the causes of their distress. Throughout his book, Prashad repeatedly reproaches society for forgetting the poorAchastising Bobby McFerrin, for example, for releasing his song Don't Worry Be Happy at a time of great economic insecurity, and castigating the medical community for not doing enough to control preventable diseases common among the poor. Though Prashad includes many revealing insights about South Asians in America, at times his book seems more like a scattered collection of anecdotal lectures than a cogent analysis of race relations among minority groups in our nation.

Cosby</b>, Author, <i>Giving Up Gimmicks: Reclaiming Youth Ministry from an Entertainment Culture</i><br><br>"Martha and Kent have had long-time ministries devoted to knowing the Word of God deeply and applying the Word of God practically to the everyday issues of life. Modesty is a sensitive subject that needs to be taught year by year as styles change and bodies change. Martha and Kent use their diverse experiences and perspectives to carefully apply the Bible's teaching on the heart of modesty. We highly recommend it to you." --<b>John and Lynn Crotts</b><br><br>"Martha Peace and Kent Keller have provided an invaluable resource for teenaged girls on the oft-overlooked topic of modesty. This well organized book asks all the right questions and systematically answers them by the use of biblical truth. If young women are not taught the truth about the gospel reasons for modesty, they often form opinions and habits that are difficult to change. The study of this short book will provide a framework for thinking through this issue that does not involve legalistic checklists but does involve taking seriously what a huge responsibility young women have as they make clothing choices. Martha Peace has included many practical examples from her point of view. The addition of Kent's perspective as a father is so helpful. It is refreshing to see this topic elevated to the importance that it deserves! May the Lord use it to convince, convict, and encourage." --<b>Mary K. Mohler</b>, Wife of R.

But at the library, she finds &#x201c;shelter from the storm&#x201d; and safe worlds<br> to explore. The authors&#x2019; rhyming text, though reflective of a child&#x2019;s fears (junkyard monsters, dogs,<br> neglected buildings), does not always flow naturally, but the message is loud and clear. This is a testament<br> to the value of reading and the imagination as ways to understand feelings and the world. Strickland&#x2019;s<br> illustrations bring Louise&#x2019;s world to life; the objects of fear, in dark colors and threatening profiles,<br> dominate the pages until the world of the library embraces her. Off comes her hooded coat, the sun comes<br> out, and she now dominates her environment. We even see a close-up of her face, totally absorbed in a<br> book, a friendly dog by her side. A cozy way to address the subject of fears&#x2014;and to get children to the<br> library.

But when the news of his selection becomes public, she comes under pressure from outraged family members and into collision with hungry journalists, opportunistic politicians, and even Khan himself.

When a Muslim architect wins a blind contest to design a Ground Zero Memorial, a city of eleven million people takes notice. Waldman, a former bureau chief for the <i>New York Times</i>, explores a diversity of viewpoints around this fictional event, bringing in politicians, businessmen, journalists, activists, and normal people whose lives--whether by happenstance, choice, or even due to their country of origin--get caught up in the controversy. Incredibly, she manages to keep all the balls in the air without ever fumbling. The story is moving and keeps the pages turning, but there are also bigger themes at work: of individuals versus groups; about the purpose of art, commerce, government, and journalism in society; of how people respond to grief and terror. The result is honest, compelling, and breathtaking.<i>--Chris Schluep</i></p><b>Amy Waldman</b> was co-chief of the South Asia bureau of <i>The New York Times</i>.

This book is, like its author, a unique achievement. Weaving a vivid portrait of her own life and her bees&#39; lives through the seasons, Hubbell writes &#34;about bees to be sure, but also about other things: the important difference between loneliness and solitude . . . the accommodating of oneself to nature&#34; (Philadelphia Inquirer).</p><p>Sue Hubbell was the author of eight books, including&nbsp;<i>A Country Year</i>&nbsp;and <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book&nbsp;<i>A Book of Bees</i>. She wrote for the<i>&nbsp;New Yorker</i>, the&nbsp;<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Smithsonian</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Time</i>, and was a frequent contributor to the &#x201c;Hers&#x201d; column of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>.&nbsp;In her widely acclaimed A Country Year , Hubbell wrote about living on her 100-acre honey-producing farm in the Ozarks. Here she introduces us to the tasks and pleasures of beekeeping. Hubbell manages 300 hives, some on her own farm, others scattered about the countryside on land she rents for one gallon of honey a year. Beekeeping, we're shown, is a marvelous example of symbiosis, advantageous to humans, bees and crops. Noting that the end of one honey season is the start of the next, Hubbell begins with autumn when she checks the hives and prepares them for winter. She takes us, step by step, through the construction of a hive, explaining terms used by beekeepers. Spring brings re-queening if needed, and late summer, the harvest. Hubbell describes the collection and extraction of honeyhot, hard workto complete the season. Beekeeping has to be the apex of animal husbandry; it is a wondrous subject, and Hubbell does it justice.

The Spences have their share of misfortune, but as the sheriff's family, they've got more than most in this dry, desolate place. They're who the town turns to when there's a crisis or a need&#x2015;and during these desperate times, there are plenty of both, even if half the town stands empty as people have packed up and moved on.<br> Pearl is proud of her loving, strong family, though she often wearies of tracking down her mentally impaired older sister or wrestling with her grandmother's unshakable belief in a God who Pearl just isn't sure she likes.<br> Then a mysterious man bent on revenge tramps into her town of Red River. Eddie is dangerous and he seems fixated on Pearl. When he reveals why he's really there and shares a shocking secret involving the whole town, dust won't be the only thing darkening Pearl's world.<br> While the tone is suspenseful and often poignant, the subtle humor of Pearl's voice keeps <i>A Cup of Dust</i> from becoming heavy-handed. Finkbeiner deftly paints a story of a family unit coming together despite fractures of distress threatening to pull them apart.</p><p><b>CBA bestselling author Susie Finkbeiner is a story junkie. </b>Always has been and always will be. It seems it's a congenital condition. After decades of reading everything she could get her hands on (except for See the Eel, a book assigned to her while in first grade, a book she declared unfit for her book-snob eyes), Susie realized that she wanted to write stories of her own. She began with epics about horses and kittens (but never, ever eels). <br><br>In order to learn how to write novels, she read eclectically and adventurously. After reading the work of Lisa Samson, Patti Hill, and Bonnie Grove she realized that there was room for a writer like her in Christian fiction. Susie is also greatly inspired by the work of Jocelyn Green, Rachel McMillan, and Tracy Groot.<br><br>Her first novels, <i><b>Paint Chips</b> (2013)</i> and<i> <b>My Mother's Chamomile </b>(2014)</i> have contemporary settings. While she loved those stories and especially the characters, Susie felt the pull toward historical fiction. When she read<i> Into the Free</i> by Julie Cantrell she knew she wanted to write historical stories with a side of spunk, grit, and vulnerability. <br><br><i><b>A Cup of Dust: A Novel of the Dust Bowl</b> (2015)</i>, Finkbeiner's bestselling historical set in 1930s Oklahoma, has been compared to the work of John Steinbeck and Harper Lee (which flatters Susie's socks off). Pearl's story continues with <i><b>A Trail of Crumbs: A Novel of the Great Depression</b> (2017)</i> and <i><b>A Song of Home: A Novel of the Swing Era</b> (2018)</i>. <br><br>Susie Finkbeiner is a stay-at-home mom &amp; speaker from West Michigan.

And one dull play, it seems, can turn us off theatre for good. Playwright and theatre director Jordan Tannahill takes in the spectrum of English-language drama from the flashiest of Broadway spectacles to productions mounted in scrappy storefront theatres to consider where lifeless plays come from and why they persist. Having travelled the globe talking to theatre artists, critics, passionate patrons and the theatrically disillusioned, Tannahill addresses what he considers the culture of risk aversion&#x2019; paralyzing the form.</p><p><i>Theatre of the Unimpressed</i> is Tannahill&#x2019;s wry and revelatory personal reckoning with the discipline he&#x2019;s dedicated his life to, and a roadmap for a vital twenty-first-century theatre one that apprehends the value of liveness&#x2019; in our mediated age and the necessity for artistic risk and its attendant failures. In considering dramaturgy, programming and alternative models for producing, Tannahill aims to turn theatre from an obligation to a destination.</p><p> [Tannahill is] the poster child of a new generation of (theatre? film? dance?) artists for whom interdisciplinary&#x201d; is not a buzzword, but a way of life.&#x2019; J.

Since technology has made our lives more productive, surely it can enhance our magic too. (Have you ever thought of making your herbal infusions in an automatic-drip coffeemaker?) Technological assistance with magic is only part of the story. Morrison has filled a <i>grimoire</i> with charms that protect from car trouble and ensure the safe and timely arrival of luggage while traveling, and spells to keep a computer from crashing, which makes life in the 20th century a little less harrowing. Rather than fighting the progress of the electronic age, Morrison has tapped into the wealth it has to offer, and she shares her discoveries with anyone adventurous enough to try them. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>One of the things I really enjoy in a book is practicality. I want something that applies to me. And <i>Everyday Magic</i> does exactly that. It applies to me, and you, today and every day. <br>Instead of conjuring an image of Shakespeare's "Double, double, toil and trouble," women stirring a cauldron, Dorothy Morrison's modern Wiccan methods use a drip coffee maker and a slow cooker. Instead of preventing an attack on a castle, this book has chants to make sure your scanner and printer work properly. This is a book of magic for today! <br>Because our days are so filled with things we have to do, we are all short of one precious commodity: time. So the spells, rituals, exercises and methods here are quick to do. For example, if you need to alleviate fear, simply write down your fears on a piece of paper. Then tear up the paper and put the scraps in a fire-proof dish. Sprinkle Mars incense (the formula -- and how to make it -- is given, of course) on top of the scraps and light it. After it is burnt out, flush the ashes down the toilet. Simple. Easy. Done with everyday objects. But it is also very powerful! <br>No matter what your level of magical practice, you're going to find this book is very helpful to you. The methods for using modern tools alone will have you wondering why you didn't use them before. The magical methods of dealing with modern life will have you smiling and running out to try them right away! <br>Many people say that Wicca is very old. But it is also new and fresh and young -- and capable dealing with any difficulties that may arise in your life. This book is proof of that.

They pervade every chapter and almost every verse. You may be surprised to read this, since the dominant view of Leviticus is that it consists only of rituals, such as sacrifices and impurities. This, too, is true: Leviticus does discuss rituals.

One of the most significant musicals of the 20th Century, &#x201c;Shuffle Along&#x201d; was a rarity, written, produced, and acted wholly by African Americans. For the first time racially diverse audiences celebrated the uniqueness of this musical together. While the New York Times praised Eubie Blake "swinging and infectious score," it panned the rest of the production &#x201c;as extremely crude&#x2014;in writing, playing and direction." That didn&#x2019;t matter. New Yorkers, including George Gershwin and Fanny Brice, flocked to it and it soon became the most popular production of the season with record breaking sales. Its influences were felt throughout the 1920s when "Shuffle Along" type musicals became all the vogue.</p><p></p><h2>Blue Iris: Poems and Essays</h2><p>A rich collection of ten poems, two essays, and two dozen of Mary Oliver's classic works on flowers, trees, and plants of all sorts, elegantly illustrated, Blue Iris is the essential companion to <i>Owls and Other Fantasies</i>, one of the best-selling volumes of poetry of 2003 and a Book Sense 76 selection.</p><p>A private person by nature, <b>Mary Oliver</b> (1935&#x2013;2019) gave very few interviews over the years. Instead, she preferred to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. The <i>New York Times</i> recently acknowledged Mary Oliver as &#x201c;far and away, this country&#x2019;s best-selling poet.&#x201d; Born in a small town in Ohio, Oliver published her first book of poetry in 1963 at the age of 28; <i>No Voyage and Other Poems</i>, originally printed in the UK by Dent Press, was reissued in the United States in 1965 by Houghton Mifflin. Oliver has since published twenty books of poetry and six books of prose. As a young woman, Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but took no degree. She lived for several years at the home of Edna St. Vincent Millay in upper New York state, companion to the poet&#x2019;s sister Norma Millay. It was there, in the late &#x2019;50s, that she met photographer Molly Malone Cook. For more than forty years, Cook and Oliver made their home together, largely in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where they lived until Cook&#x2019;s death in 2005. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver has received numerous awards. Her fourth book, <i>American Primitive</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She has also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for House of Light; the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence. Oliver&#x2019;s essays have appeared in <i>Best American Essays</i> 1996, 1998, 2001; the Anchor Essay Annual 1998, as well as Orion, Onearth and other periodicals. Oliver was editor of <i>Best American Essays</i> 2009. Oliver&#x2019;s books on the craft of poetry, <i>A Poetry Handbook</i> and <i>Rules for the Dance</i>, are used widely in writing programs. She is an acclaimed reader and has read in practically every state as well as other countries. She has led workshops at various colleges and universities, and held residencies at Case Western Reserve University, Bucknell University, University of Cincinnati, and Sweet Briar College. From 1995, for five years, she held the Catharine Osgood Foster Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College.

Can the original Hank and Molly coexist in the same world as their clones? In <i>Upgrade Soul</i>, McDuffie Award-winning creator Ezra Claytan Daniels asks probing questions about what shapes our identity-Is it the capability of our minds or the physicality of our bodies? Is a newer, better version of yourself still you? This page-turning graphic novel follows the lives of Hank and Molly as they discover the harsh truth that only one version of themselves is fated to survive.</p><p>I barely knew who I was when I first wrote out the title, "Upgrade Soul", in a notebook. I was 21, and had the idea to write a metaphorical horror story about my deepest fear, which had become my reality: I'd moved away from my hometown in Iowa, where I didn't know of any artists my age better than me, to attend a fine art college in Portland, Oregon, where I immediately discovered I didn't even know the meaning of "better".<br><br>That paranoid, post-pubescent existential terror never really went away, but it took over 15 years of turning it around in my head for it to congeal into something communicable: The horror of "better" lies in its subjectivity. Is young better than old? Is tall better than short? Is abled better than disabled? Is white better than black? Why? According to whom?<br><br>The horror of "better" is truly felt by one who feels deemed arbitrarily "worse". Upgrade Soul is, in a way, a record of my attempt to explore that idea. I may not have come up with all the answers I sought, but in my pursuit of them, I've certainly grown into a better person.<br><br>- Ezra Claytan DanielsEZRA CLAYTAN DANIELS is a writer, illustrator, and designer based in Los Angeles, CA.

The result--one of the 20 profiles drawn from magazines such as <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> for this collection--is a vivid window into the life of an ordinary and endearing boy from New Jersey who grapples with girls, environmental destruction, and the magical childhood landscape "that erodes from memory a little bit every day." Orlean has two tricks up her sleeve that make her profiles irresistible. First, she's got a mean hook. Take this lead: "Of all the guys who are standing around bus shelters in Manhattan dressed in nothing but their underpants, Marky Mark is undeniably the most polite." Second, she has an uncanny way of drawing her subjects. Bill Blass "is a virtuoso of the high-pitched eyebrow and the fortissimo gasp," while a boxer (the dog kind) wears "the earnest and slightly careworn expression of a small-town mayor." <p> Orlean is a New Yorker herself, and most of her subjects hail from the Big Apple, including such unique personas as a real estate broker who can describe the inside of almost any apartment in the city ("Walking down a Manhattan street with her is a paranormal experience"); Nat, the new tailor at Manhattan Valet; her hairdresser; the city's most popular clown; an Ashanti king who drives a taxi; and the owner of the only buttons-only store in America. The author is keenly observant and always tries to walk in her subject's shoes, even when it's a show dog ("If I were a bitch, I'd be in love with Biff Truesdale"). When she does tackle the rich and famous, she uses these same talents to create portraits so intimate and zesty they're unlike any other. Orlean writes that her only justification for choosing a story is that she cares about it, and it shows. Her fondness for her subjects rubs off as she draws us into the tight and exquisite focus of their mundane and fascinating lives. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>ing author of The Orchid Thief is back with this delightfully entertaining collection of her best and brightest profiles.

The everyday fears, traumas, and resistances that therapy addresses brush up against such broader concerns as terrorism, insurance, addiction, artistic creation, and political revolution. Taking up a project than joins the work of many French thinkers, such as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Luc Nancy, H�l�ne Cixous, Giorgio Agamben, and Catherine Malabou, Dufourmantelle works to dislodge Western philosophy, psychoanalysis, ethics, and politics from the redemptive logic of sacrifice.

Using new approaches, contemporary scholars have begun to synthesize this material with the biblical traditions. <em>The Oxford History of the</em> <em>Biblical World</em> incorporates the best of this scholarship, and in chronologically ordered chapters presents the reader with a readable and integrated study of the history, art, architecture, languages, literatures, and religion of biblical Israel and early Judaism and Christianity in their larger cultural contexts. The authors also examine such issues as the roles of women, the tensions between urban and rural settings, royal and kinship social structures, and official and popular religions of the region.<br> Understanding the biblical world is a vital part of understanding the Bible.

These contributors bring varied perspectives to their work as they draw from new primary and secondary sources based on recent archaeological excavations (often their own) and on translations of texts such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Organized chronologically, the essays explore the many cultures of ancient Canaan, Israel, Judea, and Palestine from 10,000 B.C.E. to the rise of Islam in the seventh century C.E. Illustrations, maps, charts, chronologies, and bibliographies enhance the uniformly well-written essays. But the strengths of the work are its currency and breadth of coverage and perspective. Appropriate for all libraries with collections in religion or Near Eastern studies, and of particular interest to students of biblical history and archaeology.

One of his earliest published works illustrates the parallel, preserving&nbsp; thought and design at&nbsp;a prophetic moment, shortly before Wright's genius and&nbsp;fame captured two continents and many converts. The Wasmuth portfolio of drawings (named after the original German publisher) is&nbsp;reproduced here from an extremely rare first edition (1910).<br>Wright's polemical preface indicates the importance he attached to the drawings and their publication: ". . . the work illustrated in this volume, with the exception&nbsp;of the work of Louis Sullivan, is the first consistent protest in bricks and mortar against this pitiful waste [academic, inorganic styles]. It is a serious attempt to formulate some industrial and aesthetic ideals that in a quiet, rational way will help to make a lovely thing of an American's home environment. . . ." "Home environment" for Wright was the Midwestern plain; these these drawings, perhaps his earliest experiments in organic design, partake&nbsp;of the Illinois, Indiana,&nbsp;Michigan and Wisconsin prairie with their emphasis on the horizontal ("the line of domesticity") and the environmental motif: "A beautiful elm standing near gave the suggestion for the mass of the building," Wright says of the Winslow house in River Forest, Illinois, a dwelling he cites as the first embodiment of many of his ideas. Elegant full-page architectural drawings and plans&nbsp;show Wright's atelier in Oak Park, Illinois, many homes, cottages, banks, a burial chapel, Unity Church temple, a concrete house designed for <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> and numerous studies for buildings, treated as problems in design, that were never built.<br>The republication of this rare work gives access again to what has been called "the single most important collection of work published by Frank Lloyd Wright." Students of American architectural genius will find here the seeds of Wright's greatness.</p></p><p>American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867&#x2013;1959) designed more than 1,000 structures in a career that spanned eight decades. A leader of the Prairie School of architecture, he also designed interiors, wrote 20 books, and was a popular lecturer.</p><h2>The Complete Book of Spells, Ceremonies &amp; Magic</h2><p><p>This book is far more than a historical survey of magical techniques throughout the world.

Migene Gonzalez-Wippler's <i>The Complete Book of Spells, Ceremonies &amp; Magic</i> is one of those books. When it first appeared it received wide acclaim in the U.S. and in England. I still have my original copy. <br> <br>But as frequently happens with even the best of books, it went out of print. When it became available to be republished, I enthusiastically went for it! Migene writes that her intention in writing this book was "to show the importance of the practice of magic in the development of the human psyche. I don't believe in the <i>supernatural</i>. I believe in nature and all things natural. Everything that happens in this world <i>always</i> happens through natural channels and in accordance with immutable cosmic laws." This book may well be the ultimate proof of that belief. <br> <br>This is an amazing cross-cultural compendium of magic, theory, ritual, spells and lore. If you do magic, it will give you new directions and techniques that can advance and enhance what you do. If you would like to know about magic, this book presents the subject from the viewpoint of not only a scholar, but a practitioner. And for people interested in native cultures around the world, this book is also an invaluable resource. <br> <br>In these pages you will learn all of the basics of magic, from meditation and astral projection to evocation of spirits. It covers methods of divination and the Kabbalah as well as folk magic spells for health, wealth, prosperity and romance. <br> <br>I highly recommend this book. If you are a magician it simply must be among your collection of books. I know you will refer to is frequently.

Here, in beautiful photographs, the first as-built measured plans, and an intimate narrative by a key figure, is the fascinating story of this masterwork.</b> <br> <br>Fallingwater is the most famous modern house in America. Indeed, readers of the <i>Journal of the American Institute of Architects</i> voted it the best American building of the last 125 years! Annually, more than 128,000 visitors seek out Fallingwater in its remote mountain site in southwestern Pennsylvania. Considered Frank Lloyd Wright's domestic masterpiece, the house is recognized worldwide as the paradigm of organic architecture, where a building becomes an integral part of its natural setting.<br> <br>This charming and provocative book is the work of the man best qualified to undertake it, who was both apprentice to Wright and son of the man who commissioned the house. Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., closely followed the planning and construction of Fallingwater, and lived in the house on weekends and vacations for twenty-seven years-until, following the deaths of his parents, he gave the house in 1963 to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy to hold for public enjoyment and appreciation.<br> <br>This is a personal, almost intimate record of one man's fifty-year relationship to a work of genius that only gradually revealed its complexities and originality. With full appreciation of the intentions of both architect and client, Mr. Kaufmann described this remarkable building in detail, telling of its extraordinary virtues but not failing to reveal its faults. One section of the book focuses on the realities of Fallingwater as architecture. A famous building right from its beginnings (only partly because it was Wright's first significant commission in more than a decade), Fallingwater has accumulated considerable publicity and analysis-much of it off the mark. Mr. Kaufmann outlined and dealt with the common misunderstandings that have obscured the building's true values and supplied accurate information and interpretations. In another section Mr. Kaufmann provided an in-depth essay on the subtleties of Fallingwater, the ideology underlying its esthetics. A key element of this is the close interweaving of the house and its rugged, challenging setting, which he explicated in fascinating detail.<br> <br>The author maintained throughout the direct approach of one who knew and loved Fallingwater. As an apprentice and loyal admirer of the architect, Mr. Kaufmann was well attuned to the architecture. And as a retired professor of architectural history and frequent lecturer and panelist, he had considerable experience in presenting and interpreting Wright's ideas. Thoroughly versed in the books, articles, drawings, and buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright, Mr. Kaufmann was eminently situated to place Fallingwater in that context. This unique record was presented in celebration of Fallingwater's fiftieth anniversary.<br> <br>Special features of this volume include: numerous never-before published photographs of the house under construction, during its entire history, and of the family in residence; a room-by-room pictorial survey in full color taken especially for this volume; isometric architectural perspectives that explain visually how the house was constructed; and the first accurate, measured plans of the house as built.</p><p><b>Edgar J. Kaufmann, Jr.</b> (1910-1989), entered Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship in 1934. During Fallingwater's design and construction, he often served as intermediary between his parents and Wright. Subsequently, Mr. Kaufmann joined the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, became editorial adviser to <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica,</i> and taught at Columbia University. Mr. Kaufmann was the author, editor, or contributor to several design and architecture books and wrote numerous articles. He served on the Editorial Board of the Architectural History Foundation.<br>Excerpt from: <b> <i>Fallingwater</i> </b> <br> <br>Introduction: The House and the Natural Landscape: A Prelude to Fallingwater by Mark Girouard<br> <br>A charming drawing by Thomas Hearne shows Sir George Beaumont and Joseph Farington sketching a waterfall in the Lake District, sometime in the 1770s. Waterfalls were being visited and sketched all over the British Isles at this period. But although gentlemen of taste sketched waterfalls, they did not build houses by them, still less over them. Nonetheless, a continuous thread connects Sir George Beaumont, sketching his waterfall in the 1770s, to Edgar J. Kaufmann, commissioning Frank Lloyd Wright to build Fallingwater in the 1930s. Between them lies a gradual development of the romantic imagination, and of attitudes to the natural landscape and to the problem of how buildings should, or should not, be fitted into it.<br> <br>In the eighteenth century, when English travelers first began to appreciate natural scenery, and to tour the mountains, lakes, rocks, waterfalls, and wild places of the British Isles, their attitude was by no means uncritical. For them "nature" was the supreme arbiter, but by "nature" they understood a Platonic ideal that actual natural scenery did not necessarily live up to. They had come to their appreciation by way of art and poetry, and traveled with minds conditioned by the way artists had painted wild landscapes, or poets had written about them, in both cases selecting and adjusting in order to compose a picture or a poem. A guide to the Lake District, first published in 1778, set out to take tourists "from the delicate touches of Claude, verified in Coniston Lake, to the noble scenes of Poussin, exhibited on Windermere-water, and from there to the stupendous romantic ideas of Salvator Rosa, realized in the Lake of Derwent." When looking at a view, travelers would pass judgment on it, and mentally readjust it if necessary.<br> <br>Scenery was condemned for being too simple or too bare. A landscape of heather and rocks needed trees to break its outlines and give it light and shade. "Mere rocks," wrote Thomas Whately in his <i>Observations on Modern Gardening</i> (1770), "may surprise, but can hardly please; they are too far removed from common life, too barren and inhospitable, rather desolate than solitary, and more horrid than terrible." Rocks were improved by water falling over or running through them; this produced a broken light and a broken sound that was both picturesque and pleasing. Trees, rocks, and water joined together in the right proportions made up a picturesque composition.<br> <br>Conventions developed about what did, or did not, go with particular views or features. Some types of buildings harmonized with waterfalls: Whately, for instance, described with approval "an iron forge, covered with a black cloud of smoke, and surrounded with half-burned ore" next to the "roar of a waterfall" on the River Wye. It suggested "the ideas of force or of danger" and was "perfectly compatible with the wildest romantic situations." But a regular house next to a waterfall was a solecism: it spoiled the picture because it had the wrong associations. Looked at the other way, a wild landscape coming right up to a house spoiled the house. "And while rough thickets shade the lonely glen, Let culture smile upon the haunts of men," wrote Richard Payne Knight in his poem <i>The Landscape</i> (1795). A house of any size needed a park, and a park while it should never be formal, had "a character distinct from a forest; for while we admire, and even imitate, the romantic wildness of nature, we ought never to forget that a park is the habitation of men." (Humphry Repton, <i>An Enquiry into the Changes in Landscape Gardening,</i> 1806)<br> <br>So it came about that when eighteenth-century devotees of the picturesque painted or drew "the romantic wildness of nature" they depicted it without domestic accompaniments; when they imitated it, they imitated it out of sight of their houses; and when they went to live in it, they inserted an intermediary zone of culture and cultivation between house and wilderness. Hafod in Wales, for instance, which was the most famous wild demesne in eighteenth-century Britain, was renowned for its waterfalls. But none of these was in sight of the house, which was built in a more pastoral setting of greensward and grazing cattle.<br> <br>Country-house owners whose property did not happen to contain waterfalls not infrequently constructed an artificial one. At Bowood, in Wiltshire, Lord Shelburne made one at the end of an artificial lake, after the model of a picture by Poussin. Lord Stamford&#x2019;s new cascade at Enville in Staffordshire was described with enthusiasm by Joseph Heely: "I think I never saw so fine an effect from light and shade, as is here produced by the gloom of evergreens and other trees, and the peculiar brightness of the foaming water." (<i>Letters on the Beauties of Hagley, Envil and the Leasowes,</i> 1777) But neither fall was in sight of the house. The most that was considered suitable to embellish a waterfall was a statue or inscription, perhaps to a departed relative or friend, suitable to the mood of gentle melancholy induced by the sound of water; or a seat from which to admire it. The latter had to be in the right mode, however, like that at the Leasowes, near Enville: "a rude seat, composed of stone, under rugged roots."<br> <br>Unlike ordinary houses, castles, especially ruined castles, were also considered appropriate features in wild scenery. They definitely had the right romantic connotations. But sometimes castles were still lived in, and sometimes they needed to be rebuilt. Culzean Castle in Ayrshire, for instance, was an old fortified house on a cliff top overlooking the sea. Its position was superb, its family associations were valued, but as a house the building failed to meet the late-eighteenth-century standards of accommodation and comfort. Between 1777 and 1792 it was rebuilt to the designs of Robert Adam, but in his own individual version of a castle style, in sympathy with its site. The new house rose straight from the cliffs, like the old one.<br> <br>Culzean pioneered a fresh approach, based on the idea that the architecture of a new house could be adapted to fit it to a wild situation. In the early nineteenth century a number of such houses were built, on dramatic sites or in wild settings, even when there had been no house there before. Normally they were built in a castle manner, but some, like Dunglass in Haddingtonshire, were built in the classical style, though on an asymmetric plan and with a broken outline, to fit the site. Such houses continued to be built through the nineteenth century. In the 1870s the architect Richard Norman Shaw established his reputation by designing Leyswood in Sussex, and Cragside in Northumberland, on dramatic rocky sites to which the houses played up with fragmented plans, soaring verticals, and picturesquely broken roofs. Shaw was consciously continuing the picturesque tradition, but, on the whole, new houses in this kind of position were built comparatively seldom in the British Isles.<br> <br>When clients or architects did opt for a wild site it was usually an elevated one, with the house rising out of wild nature rather than melting into it. This was partly because such houses were built for people of position, who wanted their place of residence to have a degree of importance; but also because houses on higher land had a view, and enclosed low-lying situations were thought to be unhealthy. It was probably for these reasons that houses down by waterfalls were a rarity.<br> <br>There was one building type, however, that could appropriately be designed to melt into its surroundings. This was the cottage. An interest in natural scenery had almost inevitably led to an appreciation of the way in which nature worked on and weathered man-made structures. Ruins appealed to eighteenth-century eyes in part because they were usually overgrown with moss and creepers. Artists on the look-out for picturesque effects also began to take an interest in old cottages, particularly when they were so dilapidated that nature seemed to be taking them over, to the delight of the artist if not of the inhabitants. "Moral and picturesque ideas do not always coincide," as William Gilpin put it. (<i>Observations on Several Parts of England,</i> 1808)<br> <br>From the mid-eighteenth century onward similar effects, suitably adapted to cope with problems of keeping out wind and weather, began to be incorporated into new buildings. Thatched roofs, rough undressed stonework, and creeper-clad porches and verandahs made of untrimmed branches, often with the bark left on them, were especially popular. To begin with these elements were confined to buildings such as grottoes, hermitages, and bathhouses, which were built as features in a park rather than to be lived in. But by the end of the eighteenth century they were being used for residential cottages. These included elaborate "cottages orn�es," designed for the residence of ladies and gentlemen themselves, especially when they were on holiday by the seaside, or in retreat from the responsibilities of an active life. In such situations dignity and importance were not called for; people went to live in a cottage orn�e specifically in order to feel that they were escaping from the conventions of society and tasting something of the rural innocence that poets had always associated with cottage life: "the insinuating effusions of the muse, that true happiness is only to be found in a sequestered and rural life," as William Heely put it.<br> <br>Perhaps the most alluring cottage orn�e ever built is the so-called Swiss Cottage at Cahir, in southern Ireland. It was designed, possibly by John Nash, for the Earl of Glengall in about 1820. Its position is a singularly beautiful and peaceful one, on a low rise above a reach of the River Suir. The cottage was, and is, almost swallowed up by the woods that envelop it, and by its own thatched roofs and rustic verandahs. Inside, however, a selection of highly fashionable French wallpapers kept Lord Glengall in touch with metropolitan society.<br> <br>Swiss Cottage is worth comparing with the "cabin" built for or by Jean-Jacques Rousseau near the chateau of Ermenonville, where he spent the last years of his life. The cabin, as described in an anonymous <i>Tour to Ermenonville</i> (1785), was "built against the rock and thatched with heath. Within, besides a plain and unornamented fireplace, we found a seat cut out of the rock, and covered with moss, a small table and two wicker chairs." On the door was the inscription "It is on the tops of mountains that man contemplates the face of nature with real delight. There it is that, in conference with the fruitful parent of all things, he receives from her those all powerful inspirations, which lift the mind above the sphere of error and prejudice."<br> <br>The cabin clearly related to rustic hermitages in English gentlemen&#x2019;s parks, but it related with a difference. For one thing it was not in a park; it was on a hilltop in what contemporaries called a "desert," a stretch of completely unimproved heath a mile or two from the chateau. Round the chateau itself its owner had created conventionally picturesque grounds in the English manner, complete with an artificial cascade and a monument to Rousseau, erected after his death on an island in a lake. The English visitor was struck by the contrast between all this and the adjacent "desert." Rousseau himself had used the cabin on "excursions, during which he loved to read the great book of nature, on the tops of mountains, or in the depths of some venerable forest."<br> <br>A new note is being struck, the note of the Romantic Movement, which grew out of appreciation of the picturesque, overlapped it, but was essentially different from it. Wild natural scenery ceased to be looked at with a critical eye, as something to be enjoyed but also improved, in the light of a literary or artistic tradition; the simple life ceased to be seen as a form of agreeable play-acting. Nature, in the sense of actual wild landscape not a lost ideal, was now to be approached with reverence, as a means of regeneration and a source of mystical experience. Rousseau was a pioneer, but in the first half of the nineteenth century the attitudes he had helped to inaugurate spread through the Western world.<br> <br>The idea of the picturesque had inevitably come to America, but its American devotees were at a disadvantage. America had no ruined abbeys, castles, or temples, nor landscapes rich with suitable associations. For a time Americans felt deprived when they looked at their own scenery. The Romantic Movement reversed the situation. "All nature is here new to art," English-born Thomas Cole wrote of the Catskill Mountains in the 1830s, in celebration not in a mood of despondency. "No Tivolis, Ternis, Mont Blancs, Plinlimmons, hackneyed and worn by the pencils of hundreds, but primeval forests, virgin lakes and waterfalls." (Quoted by Charles Rockwell, <i>The Catskill Mountains,</i> 1873.) "Here," wrote American-born Washington Irving in <i>Home Authors and Home Artists,</i> "are locked up mighty forests which have never been invaded by the axe; deep umbrageous valleys where the virgin soil has never been outraged by the plough; bright streams flowing in untasked idleness, unburthened by commerce, unchecked by the mill. This mountain zone is in fact the great poetical zone of our country."<br> <br>As early as 1823-24 the hotel known as the Catskill Mountain House was built on the edge of a cliff in the heart of the range. Forty years later it was still going strong, and being celebrated in verse by Charles Rockwell:<br> <br> <i>There it stands, to bless the pilgrim / From the city&#x2019;s heated homes / Worn and weary with life&#x2019;s contest / To this mountain height he comes.</i> <br> <br>By the middle decades of the century spreading railways and growing cities were bringing more and more visitors to mountainous or wild country all over America. Its apparently inexhaustible wealth of wild landscape was accepted as one of its chief glories; so was the role of this landscape as a source of cleansing, refreshment, and spiritual recharging for tired city-dwellers.<br> <br>The summer rush to the wilds brought architectural problems. A tent and a campfire may have been the ideal equipment with which to commune with nature, but more permanent forms of settlement inevitably developed, even if they continued to be called "camps." What were these to look like, and how could they best be fitted into wild surroundings? Any idea that wild nature could or should be "improved" had been jettisoned, nor was there any desire to interpose a barrier of cultivation between dwelling and surroundings. The Catskill Mountain House seemed to have been dropped on the edge of its precipice in an almost unaltered landscape. But the hotel itself was a porticoed neoclassical building, such as could have been found on the edge of dozens of American cities. Thomas Cole, in his superb picture of hotel and mountains, had to paint the hotel narrow-end on, in order to keep it from being too obtrusive.<br> <br>For a time experiments were made with the Swiss-chalet style, as on occasions in England. Later on in the century Norman Shaw&#x2019;s houses exerted a powerful influence on American seaside and holiday architecture, mainly on the strength of the brilliant drawings with which they had been illustrated in English architectural magazines. The rocky settings of Cragside and Leyswood were not all that different from the rocky coastline of New England; both Shaw&#x2019;s architecture and the style of draftsmanship with which it was presented are immediately recognizable in Eldon Deane&#x2019;s drawings of summer cottages at Manchester-by-the-Sea. One of them was even ca...</p><h2>Arabic Poems (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Poets Series)</h2><p>A bilingual anthology of poems from the sixth century to the present, <i>Arabic Poems</i> is a one-of-a-kind showcase of a fascinating literary tradition. <br><br> The Arabic poetic legacy is as vast as it is deep, spanning a period of fifteen centuries in regions from Morocco to Iraq. Themes of love, nature, religion, and politics recur in works drawn from the pre-Islamic oral tradition through poems anticipating the recent Arab Spring. <br><br> Editor Marl� Hammond has selected more than fifty poems reflecting desire and longing of various kinds: for the beloved, for the divine, for the homeland, and for change and renewal. Poets include the legendary pre-Islamic warrior &#x2018;Antara, medieval Andalusian poet Ibn Zaydun, the mystical poet Rabi&#x2018;a al-&#x2018;Adawiyya, and the influential Egyptian Romantic Ahmad Zaki Abu Shadi. Here too are literary giants of the past century: Khalil Jibran, author of the best-selling <i>The Prophet;</i> popular Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani; Palestinian feminist Fadwa Tuqan; Mahmoud Darwish, bard of occupation and exile; acclaimed iconoclast Adonis; and more. In their evocations of heroism, nostalgia, mysticism, grief, and passion, the poems gathered here transcend the limitations of time and place.</p><p><b>MARL� HAMMOND</b>, a Lecturer in Arabic Popular Literature and Culture at SOAS, University of London, is the author of <i>Beyond Elegy: Classical Arabic Women's Poetry in Context</i>.Foreword<br><br>Arabic poetry is as vast as it is deep, encompassing all manner of poetic expression from Morocco to Iraq and spanning more than fifteen centuries. In its early stages it formed part of an oral tradition, and there were systematic and collective efforts to transmit it to later generations. Poetry not only entertained and delighted, it also served to memorialize individuals, communities and events. When scholars and scribes of the second and third Islamic centuries (ninth and tenth centuries, ce) began to record this inheritance in writing, it served as an important foundation forknowledge. Even today,it has pride of place in the public domain, engaging the elites and the masses in equal measure, albeit in different registers.<br><br>This anthology attempts to capture the breadth and depth of the Arabic poetic legacy through its inclusion of pieces composed from pre-Islamic times through to the twenty-first century. It does not claim to offer a representative sampling, however. Instead, in an effort to lend coherence to the anthology and to appeal to the lay reader, I have selected poems reflecting sentiments of desire or longing, poems whose most immediate meanings transcend the limitations of time and space. Such expressions of yearning occur in a wide variety of genres. In addition to straight- forward love poetry, or ghazal, we find mystical poems and elegies. The nostalgic stance of the heroic odes, including the celebrated <i>Mu'allaqat,</i> with their contemplation of the beloved&#x2019;s abandoned campsite and their emphasis on cycles of death and rebirth, famine and feasting, leave the poetic persona and reader alike aching for the spring rains. Al-Shanfara&#x2019;s &#x2018;L-Poem&#x2019;, ostensibly a poem of rejection which subverts tribal values, strikes one as a portrait of a terribly lonely person longing for companionship and family. The ancient genre of &#x2018;longing for homelands&#x2019; (al-hanin ila alawtan), represented here by the &#x2018;Song of Maisuna&#x2019;, finds echoes in the selections of the exiled modern poets. Some of the pieces in the anthology read as expressions of sheer delight, or as an appreciation of everyday affairs, while others, particularly among the modern selections, express an anti-nostalgic and deeply felt yearning for change. It is hoped that the reader will find these poems diverting, moving and provocative.<br><br>Marl� Hammond<br><br><i>Note: <br></i>Pre-modern Arabic poems were not given titles.

Growing up in rural Tennessee, Daniel learned little of his roots. He began his writing career after he tried to find books for his young daughter on Native American culture and what it means to be a Cherokee. His search for an accurate and unbiased portrayal of cultural traditions was disappointing, so he decided to research and write his own book.<br><br>Daniel researched his first book, ITSE SELU: CHEROKEE HARVEST FESTIVAL, extensively. Before the book was published, he sent it to 30 different sources, including an archivist from the Museum of the Cherokee, the deputy principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian to affirm its accuracy and authenticity. Daniel and his family currently live in Pensacola, FloridaAs adults prepare to celebrate the harvesting of the corn, Little Wolf makes his usual rounds--bathing in the river, checking with his grandmother on the progress of his new moccasins, playing a game called gada yosdi --while anxiously awaiting the start of the festival. Attempting to portray Cherokee life before the advent of the Europeans, Pennington's disjointed, unfocused text is not engrossing, but it does string together a few valuable and engaging bits of Cherokee education and ritual. For example, elders teach Little Wolf and his friend to observe a spider spinning its web before they learn to weave their own fishing nets. Through considerable collaboration with anthropologists and historians, Pennington provides authentic accounts of the feast, a traditional folktale and the sacred corn dance. Stewart's illustrations, while somewhat flat, convey a sense of the characters' peacefulness and contentment. Cherokee vocabulary and pronunciation play large roles in the text--appropriately, given the advanced literacy of the Cherokee nation (a postscript tells of Sequoyah, who singlehandedly devised the written Cherokee language; a syllabary is included).

I was unfurling heavy rolls of black felt over the pitched roof. Then I would lean in and staple the felt in place with tin caps. This requires grunt labor more than skill. But I was daydreaming about snowy egrets and leaned too far. <br><br>I'm my own boss. I'm in no particular rush. The day is so clear you could bite it. It seems a good time to enjoy the view and contemplate the dazzling spectacle of women awakening to their own full powers. With a slight twist I lie on my back. <br><br>Now, I will give you my precise location and concentric geography. The roof covers a modest owner&#x2013;built home on eight acres of desert. Our house, me affixed to its south flank, faces a sheer escarpment of rose and beige sandstone. Below the cliff flows the San Juan River. Several miles southwest of my feet lies Monument Valley on the Navajo reservation. It's the home of the Mirage People, so called because it doesn't rain there often. House, river, the rez, Colorado Plateau, Utah, America, the world, the universe. <br><br>Stapled to the roof, I have serious thoughts about human potential. My Navajo neighbors have lived for centuries in a matrilineal society. In pioneer times, while the men mumbled about posses and punched each other's lights out, the grandmothers of my Anglo neighbors simply got off their horses and took care of business. Rural women could always raise roofs and corn, kids and hell. Yet today, one speaks of women marching into equality as if that were a different country. "No," I think as two turkey vultures circle above me, "we're simply occupying the rest of what has always been home." House, town, country, the world, the universe. <br><br>The turkey vultures don't see this geography of possibility. They see me, an edible, two&#x2013;legged smudge on a plywood platter. I extricate my hair and return to felt and staple gun. Before I finish, two parties pass by on the highway. They pull over and watch, then offer me jobs. But I only have one roof in me, my own, and what I'd really like to do next is to run a tractor or a government. Perhaps a particle accelerator. <br><i>May 24, 1996</i> <br><br><b>Bluff</b> <br><br>Perhaps it began with the wind. For weeks, the wind blew its dry burden of red dust down the canyons and across the open desert into our ears, our pockets, our nerves. The wind lifted up the top three inches of Arizona and dropped it on our heads. The gusts made the roots of my hair ache. No one in Bluff could remember so much wind blowing day and night, day after day. <br><br>People grew testy and distracted, but we knew our land well. We knew the stillness would return, even as we longed for it. Then one day the wind did stop. The earth tilted and Bluff slid. <br><br>After killing a policeman in nearby Colorado, three anti&#x2013;government extremists surfaced east of Bluff, where one of them shot and wounded a local deputy. Within hours, the somnolent little town turned into an armed camp with roadblocks, helicopters, SWAT teams, canine tracking units, and hundreds of edgy men in uniform darting madly about with small arsenals on their persons. <br><br>Early in the manhunt, my husband Mark and I were allowed through a roadblock late at night. We drove to our isolated house above the river. Where Bluff should have been, there was a blank space, an inky darkness. The entire town had disappeared. No one told us that residents had been evacuated. <br><br>From some obscure heap of dust balls, Mark unearthed his old shotgun, put it next to our bed. The damaged gun barrel was unnervingly curved. The label on the ammunition box showed a pleasantly plump pheasant. <br><br>As a thudding fleet of choppers passed over us, Mark told me that if I had to use the gun, I should aim for the crotch. "Whose crotch?" I asked, certain that the outlaws were all at once somewhere, anywhere, everywhere. When I took a shower, it felt like the movie <i>Psycho</i>. <br><br>The Bluff school, used as a command post, swarmed with troops. The testosterone was so thick a woman could get pregnant just by walking down the hall. The map room was strangely chilly, an oasis of detumescence. <br><br>When it was discovered that we had not evacuated, that our isolated property had not been checked, and that I was alone while Mark worked, I was given two sets of advice. <br><br>A sheriff's deputy said, "Get yourself some guns." <br><br>The FBI said, "We'll give you an escort." I took the escort. <br><br>"Get guns?" I mumbled as five FBI guys led me down my driveway. "Get myself some guns." <br><br>Obviously, I was the only person in North America without them. One token, squishy, white doughball of liberalism who still believed that if you hated government, maybe you should do something really radical to change things, like vote. <br><br>I wondered if arms against arms created an endless spin into violence. I wondered why the world had turned so vicious. I wondered why the FBI guys wore bulletproof vests and I did not. <br><br>They poised their rifles as we reached the house and, with quiet courtesy, asked me for permission to enter. <br><br>I stood outside in a limp noodle posture, my wildlife menagerie around me&#x2014;lizards, rabbits, ravens, the bullsnake that napped under the mint bushes, the flycatcher and her nest of baby birds in our eave. I looked through the glass doors at the way too many books, my stupid little piles of river rocks, the fetishes from Mexico, the Navajo mud toys. <br><br>The armed search precipitated a wholesale destruction of the lyrical. It felt dreamy and unreal, like hand grenades in a monastery. <br><br>These days, people still recount manhunt anecdotes. They recall the endless rumors, such as the one about the outlaws hijacking a UPS truck and terrorizing the Four Corners region in little brown suits. <br><br>Countless stories are told, all but the most critical one. That is, what really happened and why did these men disrupt so many lives with their survivalist fantasy, one that arms itself to the teeth and touts violence as a virtue. <br><br>Two of the fugitives remain at large. They will likely surface when they become bold or miss their mommies. Meanwhile, people in Bluff slowly reclaim the river and de&#x2013;spook their yards, trails and canyons. I look at my neighbors' faces and see a bone&#x2013;deep fatigue. <br><br>The wind has returned. It comes up every afternoon, pushing heat and dust, rattling the dry cottonwood leaves and thrashing my hair about my face. We long for stillness. <br><br>This time, no one is sure that it will come again so easily. In Bluff's deep peace, there is a severe crack. <br><br><i>July 24, 1998</i></p><h2>Dreaming Spies: A novel of suspense featuring Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER � WINNER OF THE AGATHA AWARD FOR BEST HISTORICAL NOVEL �&nbsp;<b>NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST MYSTERIES OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE SEATTLE TIMES<br></i></b><br>Laurie R.

We had just returned, after what began as a brief, light-�hearted trip to Lisbon became (need I even add the word &#x201c;inevitably&#x201d;?) tumultuous months in several countries. This was far from the first time I had stood on the terrace with a cup of tea, appreciating not being elsewhere. Although it did seem that no sooner was I enjoying the peace than something would come along to shatter it: an urgent telegram, a bleeding stranger at the door. I stirred.<br><br>&#x201c;Holmes, the rock.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are right, it&#x2019;s probably best to leave America out of the matter. Although possibly&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Holmes!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Russell, it is a rock. A rather fine rock, would you not agree? An almost . . . Japanese sort of a rock?&#x201d;<br><br>I turned my eyes from husband to granitic intruder.<br><br>Higher than my knee, with an interesting pattern of moss and lichen and a tracery of dark veins running through it, the stone had been planted&#x2014;�for &#x201c;planted&#x201d; was the word&#x2014;�in the flower bed encircling the terrace. And not in a central position, but asymmetrically, half-�concealed behind a rounded juniper. In the spring, it would almost disappear beneath Mrs Hudson&#x2019;s peonies.<br><br>Almost disappear. As it was almost Japanese. As I reflected on the massive and permanent shape, I realised that it looked as if it had risen from the Sussex earth long before juniper and peony were introduced. Before the old flint house behind me was built, for that matter&#x2014;�although it had definitely not been there when I left for Portugal the previous November.<br><br>&#x201c;It was most peculiar.&#x201d; Mrs Hudson&#x2019;s voice behind us sounded apologetic. &#x201c;These four Oriental gentlemen drove up in a lorry, and while the three young ones began to unpack the thing&#x2014;�it was wearing a sort of straw overcoat!&#x2014;�the older one marched back here to look at the terrace. He poked at the ground for a few minutes&#x2014;�hard as stone itself, it being that cold snap we had in December&#x2014;�and asked me what colour my peonies were. It&#x2019;s beyond me how he knew there were peonies at all. He was polite, you understand, but a little . . . quiet.&#x201d;<br><br>We both turned sharply to look at her. &#x201c;Did he threaten you?&#x201d; Holmes demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Heavens, no. I told you he was polite. Just . . . well, once or twice you&#x2019;ve had folk here who, shall we say, give one the feeling that it&#x2019;s good they&#x2019;re on your side. If you know what I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dangerous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I suppose. Although honestly, it was only his nature, not in the least aimed at us. In any event, Patrick was here.&#x201d; A complete non-�sequitur, since our farm-�manager looked about as threatening as one of his draught horses. &#x201c;But the fellow clearly wasn&#x2019;t about to explain. So I told him&#x2014;what colour they were, that is&#x2014;and he said he was terribly sorry, his men would need to move one of them, but that the darker one should be fine where it was, and that&#x2019;s what they did. They were careful, give them that. Seemed to know what they were doing. After they left, I&#x2019;d have had Patrick put Daisy into harness and drag the thing away into the orchard, but I thought it might be something you&#x2019;d arranged and forgot to mention. In any event, once I&#x2019;d lived with it for a few days, it grew on me, like. Peculiar ornament for an herbaceous border, but not all that bad. And I could see that the peony would be better where the Oriental gentlemen put it. So, shall I have Patrick remove it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>Under other circumstances, I&#x2019;d have read Holmes&#x2019; quick reply as an urgent need to keep her from danger, but I thought it pretty unlikely that this massive object could be hiding a bomb. Instead, I took his fast refusal to mean that this drastic addition to our accustomed view was having the same effect on him as it was on me: once the eyes had accepted the shape, the mind began to rearrange the entire garden around it. In less than the time it took to drain one cup of tea, I was beginning to suspect that, were Patrick to hitch up his horse and haul this foreign stone into the fields, our terrace would forever be a lesser place.<br><br>As Mrs Hudson said, the thing grew on a person.<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t leave a message?&#x201d; I asked our housekeeper.<br><br>&#x201c;Not as such. Although he did say one odd thing. When they were done, the others went back to the lorry but he sat, all cross-�legged and right on the paving stones, just looking at his rock. In the cold! I brought him out a travelling rug, I was that worried that he would freeze, but he took no notice.<br><br>&#x201c;I went back inside, looking out at him every so often, and I was just wondering if what I needed was Constable Beckett or the doctor, when the fellow stood up again. He walked all the way around the thing, then came and knocked on the kitchen door to give me back the rug. Neatly folded, too. I offered him a cup of tea, but he said thank you, he had to be getting on. And then he said, &#x2018;Tell your master he has a chrysanthemum in his garden,&#x2019; although how he&#x2019;d know that at this time of&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>At the name of the flower, Holmes and I looked at each other, startled.<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs Hudson,&#x201d; I interrupted, &#x201c;what did the fellow look like? Other than being Oriental.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I suppose he was a bit taller than usual. Certainly he was bigger than the other three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With a scar on his hand?&#x201d; Holmes asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, now that you ask. All down the back of his hand, it was&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>But we didn&#x2019;t wait to hear the rest of it. As one, we set our cups upon the table and strode across the terrace to the steps leading to the orchard and the Downs beyond. At the small inner gate, we turned to look. This, the more hidden side, looked as if someone had tried to carve a flower on it, a thousand years before.<br><br>Not a chrysanthemum: the Chrysanthemum.<br><br>A venerable stone we had last seen a year ago in the Emperor&#x2019;s garden in Tokyo.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Scholar-�gipsy, I,<br><br>Homecoming to a strange land,<br><br>Trinity Term&#x2019;s mist.<br><br>The following morning was wet and blustery. We took our breakfast in front of the fire, reading an accumulation of newspapers. Inevitably, the news was all about the horrors of the weather (a woman killed when a tree fell across her house), imminent threats to world peace, and the attempts at good-humoured news that convince one the human race is a lost cause. With yesterday&#x2019;s reminder of Japan, my eyes were caught no fewer than three times by the country&#x2019;s name: an art display in London, the Japanese-�Russian treaty that was going into effect soon, and the results of an inquest into a drowned Japanese translator named Hirakawa. At this last, I glanced out the window at the rain-�soaked rock, and closed the newspaper.<br><br>Minutes later, I abandoned Holmes to The Mystery of the Emperor&#x2019;s Stone (as well as a meeting he had that afternoon in London, concerning Turkey&#x2019;s upcoming Hat Law) to turn my face towards Oxford. I took the Morris, having tasks to do along the way, and although the drive promised to be difficult, as I passed through tiny East Dean, I found myself humming in time with the pistons. When I crossed the Cuckmere, I was singing aloud&#x2014;�tunelessly, yes, but with modern music, who cares?<br><br>Once my business in Eastleigh was concluded (an elderly tutor, installed there and in need of good cheer and enticing reading material), I turned north. Traffic crept around an overturned wagon outside of Winchester, and again slowed out in the countryside twenty miles later, for some reason I never did see. As a result, although I&#x2019;d intended to be in Oxford before tea-�time, I could tell that it would not be until after dark. I was glumly bent over the wheel, bleary-�eyed and trying to ignore the growing headache (a bad knock in December had yet to heal completely), when a snug and ancient building rose up alongside the road ahead: grey stone, heavy vines, yellow glow from ancient windows, wood-�smoke curling from a chimney dating to Elizabeth. With Japan so recently in my mind, for a brief instant I saw the building as a ryokan&#x2014;�an ancient inn, with steaming baths and a waiting masseur. A cook who had worked there his entire life, a welcoming tray of pale, scalding, deliciously bitter tea . . . But no, it was just a pub.<br><br>Still, my arms were already turning the steering wheel. The quiet of shutting down the engine made my ears tingle. I picked up my bag and, coat pinched over my head against the heavy drops, scurried for the door.<br><br>Heaven lay within, an ancient gathering space that could only be in England, every breath testifying to its centuries of smoke and beer, damp dogs, and the sweat of working men. I made for the massive stone fireplace, and stood close enough to feel the scorch of the glowing coals through the back of my coat. A placid barmaid took my order, while I continued to stand, revolving slowly, divesting myself bit by bit of the layers. Heavy gloves, woollen scarf, and fur hat migrated to a nearby chair, eventually joined by my fur-�lined driving coat. When my food came, I was down to a heavy cardigan, and my bright pink fingers were restored enough to grasp fork and knife.<br><br>After a few bites, I paused to retrieve a pair of books from the bag. The first was an unlikely but colourful novel I had bought in the Gare de Lyon two days earlier, by an Englishman named Forster. It was a year since Holmes and I had watched Bombay fade behind us&#x2014;�almost exactly a year, come to that: seemed like a decade&#x2014;�and I&#x2019;d bought it thinking that Forster&#x2019;s Passage might remind me of the pleasanter aspects of our trip. Instead, I was finding the plot increasingly difficult, and after another chapter I closed the covers on Dr Aziz and the criminally ridiculous Adela, to pick up the other volume, a melancholy old friend.<br><br>What is it about Oxford that puts one in a poetical state of mind? One would think that a long-�time resident like me would grow inured to Oxford poetry, if for no other reason than the sheer volume of the stuff. Every undergraduate (and most tourists) who walked through one of her doors found it necessary to sit down and compose verse about the experience, all of it romantic and most of it twaddle. But still, in private moments, Matthew Arnold crept under my guard. Who would not wish to be a scholar-�gipsy, leaving the safe walls&#x2014;�this strange disease of modern life, with its sick hurry, its divided aims&#x2014;�to learn the eternal secrets of the gipsies, like some latter-�day Merlin? Which of us had not deliberately chosen to return to the city by way of Boar&#x2019;s Hill, in hopes of glimpsing one of the few remaining views of the city below, and thus be given an excuse to murmur Arnold&#x2019;s enchanting phrase:<br><br>And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,<br><br>She needs not June for beauty&#x2019;s heightening.<br><br>I sighed, and squinted at the pub&#x2019;s rain-�streaked window. Not much of June&#x2019;s beauty-�heightening today. Were it not for the pull of Oxford&#x2014;�less its dreaming spires than its comfortable bed and waiting fire&#x2014;�I would have taken a room here and ordered another pint of the man&#x2019;s very decent beer. Instead, warm through and well fed, I paid for my meal and dashed back through the rain, wishing I had Arnold&#x2019;s luck. This winter-�eve is warm, Humid the air; leafless, yet soft as spring.<br><br>It was spring by the calendar alone, with no softness in sight. I got the wiper-�blades going and turned cautiously back out onto the road, hoping the headlamps would last until I got in.<br><br>Newbury. Abingdon. Here came I often, in old days. Too rare, too rare grow now my visits . . . <br><br>Rare, indeed. Every time I set out with the firm intention of installing myself as a fixture amongst the stacks in Oxford&#x2019;s ever-�blessed libraries, some figurative bomb went off under my feet and hauled me away. Once, a literal bomb.<br><br>Littlemore; Iffley. The morning&#x2019;s singing had long given way to groans of tedium. To keep myself awake, I recited mathematical formulae, irregular verbs, and poetry. Haiku was ideal for the purpose, being both mathematical and poetic: the 5/7/5 structure was deceptively simple, which I supposed was why old Bash&#x14d; came up with so many of them on his wanderings. What would the man have produced if he&#x2019;d been driving through rain? Perhaps&#x2014;�<br><br>Sweet city of minds:<br><br>Her spires dream, wrapped in earth&#x2019;s folds.<br><br>June gilds the lily.<br><br>Or what about:<br><br>Dark tyres splash along,<br><br>Wanting nothing better than<br><br>A place for the night.<br><br>I snorted. Matsuo Bash&#x14d; need feel no threat from me.<br><br>The tyres did indeed splash along, down the darkening road, until the edges of civilisation came down to greet me. Much more of this weather and the two Hinkseys would again be separated by swamp&#x2014;�despite the efforts of that other poet, Oscar Wilde, during his unlikely road-�building days at Magdalene. I noticed (as Matthew Arnold had foretold) that yet more houses had been raised since I last drove this way: the dreaming spires would soon vanish beneath a tide of suburban villas.<br><br>At Folly Bridge, the heavy raindrops turned to sleet. Grandpont was all but afloat. Christchurch probably had a lake at its door instead of a meadow. Even the Scholar-�Gipsy would require a roof over his head tonight. The shops on the High were shuttered, the restaurants closing, and only the drinking establishments glowed in contentment.<br><br> Chapter Two<br> Scholar-gipsy, I,<br> Homecoming to a strange land,<br> Trinity Term&#x2019;s mist.<br><br>The following morning was wet and blustery.

Her selection of her favorite stories describes powerful&#x2014;and sometimes exceedingly silly&#x2014;monarchs, and commoners who are every bit their match; musicians and dancers who live for aft rather than earthly reward; and a goldfish who wishes to "marry the Moon, surpass the Sun, and possess the World."</p><p>Eleanor Farjeon (1881-1965) grew up in England in a house filled with books, and she and her brothers enjoyed reading stories to one another and writing their own.

With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics.

This English translation of Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali is widely regarded as the most authoritative and authentic that has been available in recent times. It is a serious and clear presentation of Patanjali&#39;s sutras and Vyasa&#39;s Bhasya, providing these basic texts both in the original Sanskrit and in readable and accurate English. These classical works are augmented by the commentary of Swami Hariharananda Aranya, a scholar and yogi of great repute, who, in his lifetime, was the foremost exponent in India of the Samkhya Yoga system of which the Yoga Aphorisms of Patanjali are the principal work.</p><p>Text: English&#34;It is the most readable and reliable account of classical yoga that I know. There are, of course, numerous secondary works on yoga, many of which are useful and some of which have considerable scientific value. There are few good editions of the actual primary sources, however, and Hariharananda&#39;s is one of those.&#34; -- Gerald J. Larson, Professor of Philosophy, University of California, Santa Barbara</p><h2>Hard Math for Elementary School</h2><p><i>Hard Math for Elementary School</i> is new category of math book. The author, MIT professor Glenn Ellison, calls it a math enrichment textbook. The idea is to make it easy for teachers or parents to supplement what kids are getting in school with with complementary lessons that are harder, deeper, and more fun.<br> <i>Hard Math</i> has chapters to accompany most textbook topics: addition with carrying, multiplication, fractions, etc. It covers other important topics - prime numbers, counting, probability - that are being squeezed out of many curricula. And it has chapters on topics which may not be as important -- tiling floors, solving number puzzles, making polyhedra out of marshmallows and toothpicks -- but that make the book more fun and develop higher-level reasoning skills. <br> <i>Hard Math</i> can be used in many different ways. Some parents will enjoy reading it together with their child. A teacher can give the book to an exceptional student who could read through it on her own whenever she's done early with the regular math lesson. Or a teacher could treat the book as a set of lesson plans for his or her top math group: each section of the book can serve as a set of lecture notes and the students could then work separately or together on the corresponding workbook page. <i>Hard Math</i> can similarly be a blueprint for an after school math club.<br> <i>Hard Math</i> is designed to be accessible to very advanced 3rd graders. But <i>Hard Math</i> is very hard. Most parents will find that there's a lot in it that they don't know and most advanced kids will be better off waiting until at least 4th grade to try it.<br> A workbook (sold separately) contains over 100 challenging worksheets to reinforce the lessons of each section. An answer key for the workbook is also available (and cheap).</p><p>Glenn Ellison is the Gregory K. Palm Professor of Economics at MIT. He is also the parent of three daughters and has spent many hours coaching middle school math teams and working with informal groups of younger and older kids in his kitchen classroom."Does math class make your child feel like a hamster in a cage stuck in a wheel of an endlessly repetitive "spiral curriculum" with little to challenge or inspire her? If you answered yes, then this book could provide a much-needed breath of fresh air. ... Written in a good-natured conversational style, <i>Hard Math for Elementary School</i> lays the foundation for elementary school students to develop the tools and habits of confident, capable, and curious problem solvers." --Mary O'Keeffe, founder, Albany Area Math Circle<br><br>"The author has excellent taste ... &nbsp;The book is full of great insights and tricks which would make even a professional mathematician smile. ... I wish that the book would replace all other books currently used to teach math to elementary school kids."-- Richard Schwartz, Chancellor's Professor of Mathematics, Brown University. Author, <i>You Can Count on Monsters</i> and<i> Really Big Numbers</i><br><br>"... well written based on Prof. Ellison's invaluable experience teaching and achieving wonderful results in every single stage: elementary school, middle school, and high school."-- Zuming Feng, Coach and Team Leader, U.S. International Math Olympiad Team.

She has led teams implementing solutions ranging from enterprise supply chain management to digital media, and built one of 3M's first Just-in-Time Lean production systems. Mary is the president of Poppendieck LLC, which specializes in bringing Lean techniques to software development. </p> <p> <b>Tom Poppendieck</b> is an enterprise analyst, architect, and agile process mentor with more than twenty-five years of experience developing and implementing complex systems. He currently assists organizations in applying Lean principles and tools to software development processes. </p> <br> <br><p><b>The Sequel </b></p> <p>Lean was an idea borrowed from the 1990s when we wrote the book <i>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</i> in 2003. We had observed that breakthrough ideas from manufacturing and logistics often take a decade or two before they are adapted to provide suitable guidance for development efforts. So we decided it was not too late to use well-proven lean concepts from the 1980s and 1990s to help us explain why agile methods are a very effective approach to software development.</p> <p>The strategy worked. The book <i>Lean Software Development</i> presents a set of thinking tools based on lean thinking that leaders continue to find useful for understanding agile software development. The book has been purchased by many a developer who gave it to his or her manager to read, and many managers have distributed multiple copies of the book to colleagues in support of a transition to lean/agile software development.</p> <p>Meanwhile, something unexpected happened to <i>lean</i>. In the last couple of years lean initiatives have experienced a resurgence in popularity. The word lean was originally popularized in the early 1990s to characterize the Japanese approach to automobile manufacturing. In recent years, Honda and Toyota have been doing increasingly well in the North American auto market, while Detroit automakers are restructuring. For example, Toyota's profits rose from more than $8 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2003, to more than $10 billion in 2004, $11 billion in 2005, and $12 billion in 2006. Many companies have taken a second look at lean to try to understand what's behind such steady and sustained success.</p> <p>Lean initiatives seldom start in the software development or product development area of a company, but over time, successful lean initiatives make their way from manufacturing or logistics to development departments. However, lean practices from manufacturing and other operational areas do not adapt easily to a development environment, so lean initiatives have a tendency to stall when they reach software development. While the underlying lean principles remain valid, it is usually inappropriate to apply operational practices and measurements to a development environment. When lean initiatives stall in software development areas, many companies have discovered that the book <i>Lean Software Development</i> gives them a good foundation for thinking about how to modify their approach and adapt lean ideas to a development organization.</p> <p>The benefits of lean and agile software development have become widely known and appreciated in the last few years, and many organizations are changing the way they develop software. We have traveled around the world visiting organizations as they implement these new approaches, and we have learned a lot from our interaction with people working hard to change the way they develop software. As our knowledge has grown, so has the demand for more information on implementing lean software development. We realized that a new book would allow us to share what we've learned with many more people than we can contact personally. Therefore we have summarized our experiences in this book, <i>Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash</i>.</p> <p>This book is not a cookbook for implementing lean software development. Like our last book, it is a set of thinking tools about how to go about adapting lean principles to your world. We start this book where the last book left off and go deeper into the issues and problems that people encounter when trying to implement lean and agile software development. You might consider this book a sequel to <i>Lean Software Development</i>. Instead of repeating what is in that book, we take a different perspective. We assume the reader is convinced that lean software development is a good idea, and focus on the essential elements of a successful implementation. We look at key aspects of implementation and discuss what is important, what isn't, and why. Our objective is to help organizations get started down the path toward more effective software development.</p> <p>The first chapter of this book reviews the history of lean, and the second chapter reviews the seven principles of lean software development presented in <i>Lean Software Development</i>. These are followed by chapters on <i>value</i>, <i>waste</i>, <i>speed</i>, <i>people</i>, <i>knowledge</i>, <i>quality</i>, <i>partners</i>, and the <i>journey</i> ahead. Each of these eight chapters begins with a story that illustrates how one organization dealt with the issue at hand. This is followed by a discussion of key topics we have found to be important, along with short stories that illustrate the topic, and answers to typical questions we often hear. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises that helps you explore the topics more deeply. </p> <p>Mary and Tom Poppendieck<br>July 2006</p> <br> <br></p><h2>Fundamentals of Physics</h2><p><b>A two-volume edition to engage students in understanding concepts and problem-solving</b> Volume 1 of the <i>Fundamentals of Physics, 11th Edition</i> helps students embark on an understanding of physics.

Then, in the New Testament, he examines the life and work of the incarnate Christ. The doctrines of atonement, redemption, propitiation, and reconciliation are thoroughly and clearly discussed. The book concludes with an examination of the present and future work of Christ, thus giving the reader a comprehensive study of Christology. </p></p><p>This book concludes with an examination of the present and future work of Christ, thus giving the reader a comprehensive study of Christology.<b>JOHN F.

In Key West there had been time for long flirtatious meetings, time to talk seductively about writing and political commitments. In New York they were always in a crowd, everyone drinking, rushing in and out, answering the telephone, going to the Stork Club and Twenty One. Martha was frantic herself. She needed papers for Spain, and with some difficulty persuaded her friend Kyle Crichton at Collier's magazine to give her, not exactly a job, but a letter identifying her as their special correspondent. Martha also needed money for her boat ticket to Europe.

(It ruined her skin, she told a friend years later, but it got her to Spain.)<br><br>There was nothing now to keep her.

With the decoding of the human genome, we now know that genes not only predetermine the broad structure of the brain, they also absorb formative experiences, react to social cues, and even run memory. They are consequences as well as causes of the will.</p></p><p>In the follow-up to his bestseller, <i>Genome</i>, Matt Ridley takes on a centuries-old question: is it nature or nurture that makes us who we are? Ridley asserts that the question itself is a "false dichotomy." Using copious examples from human and animal behavior, he presents the notion that our environment affects the way our genes express themselves. <p> Ridley writes that the switches controlling our 30,000 or so genes not only form the structures of our brains but do so in such a way as to cue off the outside environment in a tidy feedback loop of body and behavior. In fact, it seems clear that we have genetic "thermostats" that are turned up and down by environmental factors. He challenges both scientific and folk concepts, from assumptions of what's malleable in a person to sociobiological theories based solely on the "selfish gene." </p><p> Ridley's proof is in the pudding for such touchy subjects as monogamy, aggression, and parenting, which we now understand have some genetic controls. Nevertheless, "the more we understand both our genes and our instincts, the less inevitable they seem." A consummate popularizer of science, Ridley once again provides a perfect mix of history, genetics, and sociology for readers hungry to understand the implications of the human genome sequence. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><p>Matt Ridley is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including&nbsp;<em>The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves</em>; <em>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</em>; and <em>The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature</em>.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary noir masterpiece of historical paranoia</b>.<br><br>A&nbsp;rip-roaring, devilishly wild ride through the bloody end of the 1960's. It's dark baby, and hot hot hot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Martin Luther King assassinated. Robert Kennedy assassinated. Los Angeles, 1968. Conspiracies theories are taking hold. On the horizon looms the Democratic Convention in Chicago and constant gun fire peppers south L.A. Violence, greed, and grime, are replacing free-love and everybody from Howard Hughes, Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover to the right-wing assassins and left-wing revolutionaries are getting dirty. At the center of it all is a triumvirate: the president&#x2019;s strong-arm goon, an ex-cop and heroine runner, and a private eye whose quarry is so dangerous she could set off the whole powder keg. With his trademark deadly staccato prose, James Ellroy holds nothing back in this wild, startling and much anticipated conclusion to his Underworld USA trilogy.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2009: </strong>James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet novels chronicled a cynic's take on Los Angeles cops and robbers, carving a dark and creepy nook for the author in the world of crime fiction. With <em>Blood's a Rover</em>, Ellroy completes his Underworld USA trilogy, an epic reinvention of American history, politics, and corruption. This book comes out firing: Ellroy's hipster prose--inimitable for its high style and spectacular energy--snaps and surges through more than 600 pages like black electricity, shocking the gentle reader from page one. Opening with a heist scene rendered as coldly violent as anything from Sam Peckinpah's most sociopathic fantasies, the story hurls itself across an improbable crazy quilt plot, including Howard Hughes's Vegas power-play, political abuses and machinations in Hoover's FBI, and the mob's ubiquitous shadow, darkening everything from JFK's assassination to Nixon's 1968 Presidential campaign. Another audacious effort from a one-of-a-kind talent, <em>Blood's a Rover</em> is thrilling and exhausting, a gloriously guilty pleasure. <em>--Jon Foro</em><p>James Ellroy was born in Los Angeles in 1948.

Visit Jakob at jakobwegelius.com.<br><br>About the Translator:<br>PETER GRAVES is a translator from the Scandinavian languages and has received many Swedish Academy prizes for his translations.</p>Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;An engagingly accessible but quirky mystery featuring a gorilla named Sally Jones who not only narrates the story but can also read and write. She just doesn't talk. Sally Jones is an engineer working for Chief Koskela on his ship, the Hudson Queen, in this suspenseful and well-plotted adventure. In Lisbon, Portugal, while carrying what they think is a crate of tiles, Sally Jones and the Chief are attacked by robbers, and the ship is sunk. Things go from bad to worse when the Chief is shortly thereafter arrested for the murder of the man who hired them to transport the cargo. Sally Jones is on her own, decried by passersby as "the murderer's gorilla." Attracted to the music of a factory worker named Ana Molina, Sally Jones forges a new life but is determined to prove the Chief's innocence. It's her ability to work mechanical miracles&#x2014;even with accordions&#x2014;and her hard work ethic that help her find friends who support her on her quest for answers. A circuitous journey leads her to India and a completely fabulous maharaja. All events occur in the early part of the 20th century, when cars, planes, and typewriters were newfangled inventions. The book has been translated from Swedish and contains a series of portraits of the main cast of characters filling the opening pages, and there is surprisingly little to deter readers from immediately falling for Sally Jones and eagerly cheering her on. There are moments that are a little over-the-top or stereotypical, such as the abilities of the ape, the maharaja's wealth, and Ana's captivating voice. A new animal heroine has arrived on the scene, and while she may not rival Charlotte for her wisdom, her writing is just as engaging and her persistent loyalty equally admirable. VERDICT An unusual and oddly charming adventure. A solid purchase for medium to large middle grade collections.&#x2014;Carol A. Edwards, formerly at Denver Public Library</p><h2>Turbulent Flows</h2><p>Turbulent Flows is an up-to-date and comprehensive graduate text on this important topic in fluid dynamics. The book consists of two parts: Part I provides a general introduction to turbulent flows, how they behave, how they can be described quantitatively, and their fundamental physical processes. Part II is concerned with different approaches for modeling, or simulating, turbulent flows. Key appendices present the necessary mathematical techniques. While primarily intended for engineering graduate students, this book will also be valuable to students in applied mathematics, physics, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, as well as to researchers and practicing engineers.</p><p>This is a graduate text on turbulent flows, which is an important topic in fluid mechanics. Many university engineering departments (mechanical, aerospace, chemical, civil) offer graduate courses on turbulent flows for which this could be the required or recommended text. The book will also appeal to researchers in atmospheric sciences, oceanography, physics and applied mathematics. This book is up-to-date, comprehensive, designed for teaching and is based on a course taught by the author at Cornell University for many years."This book is a welcome addition to the literature on turbulence. It will serve well as a textbook." Journal of Fluid Mechanics<br><br>"The author made a strong pedagogical effort in writing this book. The text is supplemented by many exercises that can give a good support for courses on this subject. Moreover, most of what an engineer needs to know about the subject of fluid turbulence is covered in reasonable depth. This text is a welcome addition to the literature on turbulence, since it is the first book dedicated to the modeling of turbulence and, hence, fully dedicated to engineering students." Mathematical Reviews<br><br>"The book is intended as a graduate text designed for teaching and...it is a complete success. The author managed, in an excellent way, the balance between classical theory, research results, and phenomenological observations... really fills the gap between the excellent (but sometimes dated) old classical books and the recent specific monographs focused on particular aspects of turbulence. This reviewer strongly recommends the purchase of Turbulent Flows to all students and researchers whose field of interest is in turbulent flows and their numerical modeling. The purchase of this book by libraries should be considered a 'must' since the text can be classified as one of the pearls in the field." Applied Mechanics Reviews<br><br>"Pope's book represents the outstading contribution to the pedagogy of turbulence since Tennekes and Lumley's book...Not only does it present turbulence fundamentals in a lucid and readable manner, it also utilizes in an optimum manner various tools of learning and teaching turbulence: physical insight, mathematical derivations, scaling arguments, and experimental and DNS data...the book should be well received in both academia and industry. It will be useful to students entering the feild of turbulence as well as to experienced researchers and practicing engineers."

Led by Captain Ronald Fry, Hammerhead Six applied the principles of unconventional warfare to "win hearts and minds" and fight against the terrorist insurgency. </strong><br><br>In 2003, the Special Forces soldiers entered an area later called "the most dangerous place in Afghanistan." Here, where the line between civilians and armed zealots was indistinct, they illustrated the Afghan proverb: "I destroy my enemy by making him my friend." Fry recounts how they were seen as welcome guests rather than invaders. Soon after their deployment ended, the Pech Valley reverted to turmoil. Their success was never replicated. <em>Hammerhead Six</em> finally reveals how cultural respect, hard work (and the occasional machine-gun burst) were more than a match for the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</p><p>A third-generation veteran, US Army Captain <strong>Ronald Fry</strong> served in the 82nd Airborne Division and as a Special Forces team leader in Afghanistan. He has completed the military's Survival School and the Ranger, Pathfinder, Jumpmaster, and Combat Diver trainings. Fry lives with his wife and five children near San Jose and works in sales management. <br><br><strong>Tad Tuleja</strong>, author of 32 books, has taught courses on war and conflict at Harvard, Princeton, Oklahoma, and American University."The story told by Captain Ron Fry is not one you hear often when people talk about the war in Afghanistan--and that is precisely why everyone should read it. Through him, his men get to tell their history, in their own words, and anyone who cares about the truth should care about this. Hammerhead Six took a lot from them because it goes against their ethos as "quiet professionals," but as you will discover when you read this, integrity can be one of the most powerful weapons of war-and nothing but that can prepare you for the unintended consequences or the moments you wish had never happened . . ."&#x2015;<b><i>Lara Logan, <i>60 Minutes </i></i></b><br><br><em>"</em>Amidst torrents of hot brass and the smell of burnt gunpowder in Ron Fry's <i>Hammerhead Six </i>are nuggets of wisdom that can only come from a warrior leader who has lived outside the wire, among those he fought and those he sought to help. Riveting, compelling, transparently honest and emotional, <i>Hammerhead</i> <i>Six</i> is a must read for anyone wondering what could have worked in the 'graveyard of empires.'"&#x2015;<b><i>Tony Schwalm , author of <em>The Guerrilla Factory</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>Hammerhead Six</i> is a raw, hard-hitting and authentic war story that will become one of the most important books to emerge from the war in Afghanistan. Captain Fry tells a deeply human story that captures the remarkable courage of America's elite Special Forces soldiers. Reading it plunged me back into the exhilarating, heartbreaking experience of combat. Mr. President and Members of Congress, read this book immediately. If we do what Fry and his men did, we win the war in Afghanistan. Honestly it is that simple."&#x2015;<b><i>Sean Parnell, <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of <i>Outlaw Platoon: Heroes, Renegades, Infidels, and the Brotherhood of War in Afghanistan</i></i></b><br><br>"<em>Hammerhead Six</em> is the compelling story about a small team of brave men who were sent into the most hostile area of Afghanistan. They did what Green Berets have always done: They stood up for human rights, made friends and trained people to protect themselves. Taliban activity dropped dramatically and the surrounding area thrived. The unconventional victory of Captain Ronald Fry's unit provides inspiration and a way forward into the troubled and uncertain future. It is a textbook on how to get it right the next time."&#x2015;<b><i>Lt. Col. Marcus Custer, USA (Ret.)</i></b><br><br>"In the Special Forces tradition of combining exhilarating edge-of-your-seat suspense and challenging intellect, <i>Hammerhead Six</i> takes you down the treacherous road of what it is like to be a Green Beret in an ancient land, tasked to work by, with, and through the Afghan people to fight an elusive and brutal enemy."<b> </b>&#x2015;<b><i>Rusty Bradley, author of <i>Lions of Kandahar</i></i></b></p><h2>Athletic Body in Balance</h2><p><p><br>Great athletes make difficult moves look effortless with a combination of skill, strength, and balance.

Lutz challenges the prevailing notion that the United States Constitution was either essentially inherited from the British or simply invented by the Federalists in the summer of 1787. His political theory of constitutionalism acknowledges the contributions of the British and the Federalists. Lutz also asserts, however, that the U.S. Constitution derives in form and content from a tradition of American colonial characters and documents of political foundation that began a century and a half prior to 1787.Lutz builds his argument around a close textual analysis of such documents as the Mayflower Compact, the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the Rode Island Charter of 1663, the first state constitutions, the Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation. He shows that American Constitutionalism developed to a considerable degree from radical Protestant interpretations of the Judeo-Christian tradition that were first secularized into political compacts and then incorporated into constitutions and bills of rights. Over time, appropriations that enriched this tradition included aspects of English common law and English Whig theory. Lutz also looks at the influence of Montesquieu, Locke, Blackstone, and Hume. In addition, he details the importance of Americans' experiences and history to the political theory that produced the Constitution. By placing the Constitution within this broader constitutional system, Lutz demonstrates that the document is the culmination of a long process and must be understood within this context. His argument also offers a fresh view of current controversies over the Framers' intentions, the place of religion in American politics, and citizens' continuing role in the development of the constitutional tradition.</p></p><p><p>Donald S.

Drake, a Vietnam vet who served in the Blackhorse Regiment, uses prose as cold and hard as the metal alloy of a tank to portray the men and women of Hammer's Regiment as neither cartoon heroes nor propaganda villains but as competent professionals trying to survive in a deadly business. His bad guys are typically the politicians and extremists who think that war can be desirable and positive when it's merely sadly necessary. In "The Butcher's Bill," we see how every line trooper makes policy regardless of higher wishes, while "Hangman" shows the ethical dilemmas facing a soldier of conscience. If the 21 stories collected here present an episodic account of the Slammers' history, that's because this is the way that the line soldier experiences a campaign. In his depiction of combat, Drake (<i>The Way to Glory</i>) rivals Crane and Remarque. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She gives us a child's-eye view of a Cambodia where rudimentary labor camps for both adults and children are the norm and modern technology no longer exists. Death becomes a companion in the camps, along with illness. Yet through the terror, the members of Chanrithy's family remain loyal to one another, and she and her siblings who survive will find redeemed lives in America.</p><p>A Finalist for the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize.</p> 15 black and whtie illustrations</p><p>"Chea, how come good doesn't win over evil?" young Chanrithy Him asks her sister, after the brutal Khmer Rouge have seized power in Cambodia, but before hunger makes them too weak for philosophy. Chea answers only with a proverb: When good and evil are thrown together into the river of life, first the <i>klok</i> or squash (representing good) will sink, and the <i>armbaeg</i> or broken glass (representing evil) will float. But the broken glass, Chea assures her, never floats for long: "When good appears to lose, it is an opportunity for one to be patient, and become like God."<p> Before this proverb could come true, Chanrithy had to watch her mother, father, and five of her brothers and sisters die, murdered by the Khmer Rouge or fatally weakened by malnutrition, disease, and overwork. Now living in Oregon, where she studies posttraumatic stress disorder among Cambodian survivors, Chanrithy has written a first-person account of the killing fields that's remarkable for both its unflinching honesty and its refusal to despair. In wrenchingly immediate prose, she describes atrocities the rest of the world might prefer to ignore: her sick yet still breathing mother, thrown along with corpses into a well; a pregnant woman beaten to death with a spade, the baby struggling inside her; a sister impossibly swollen with edema, her starving body leaking fluid from the webbing between her toes. </p><p> The mind retreats from horrors like these--and yet what emerges most strongly from this memoir is the triumph of life. Chanrithy is determined to honor her pledge to the dying Chea, to study medicine so she can help others live. <i>When Broken Glass Floats</i> accomplishes the same goal in a different way. "As a survivor, I want to be worthy of the suffering that I endured," Chanrithy writes; by giving such eloquent voice to her dead, she has proven herself more than worthy of her suffering--and theirs. <i>--Chloe Byrne</i></p>, born in 1965, lives in Eugene, Oregon, where she works for the Khmer Adolescent Project, studying post-traumatic stress disorder among Cambodians.</p><h2>The Shop on Main Street: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>Steel Magnolias meets The Ya Ya Sisterhood from <em>New York Times </em>bestseller Carolyn Brown</strong></p><p>Carlene Lovelle, owner of Bless My Bloomers lingerie shop, has everything she's ever wanted: a loving husband, a successful small town business, and great friends who never disappoint.</p><p>However, that all changes when Carlene finds a pair of sexy red panties in her husband's briefcase.

He demonstrates how the true work of maturity is to grow through these levels to the self-realized state of completion and harmony. </p><p>In Johnson's view, we all reach the stages depicted by Don Quixote, Hamlet, and Faust at various times of our lives. The three represent levels of consciousness within us, each vying for dominance. Don Quixote portrays the innocent child, while Hamlet stands for our self-conscious need to act and feel in control though we have no real connection to our inner selves. Faust embodies the master of the true self, who has gained awareness by working through the stages. </p></p><p><p> Robert A. Johnson, a noted lecturer and Jungian analyst, is also the author of <em>He, She, We, Inner Work, Ecstasy, Transformation,</em> and <em>Owning Your Own Shadow. </em></p>On the heels of Robert Bly's best-selling Iron John ( LJ 11/15/90), comes this slim volume which offers quite a different assessment of maleness and its self-completion. Johnson, author of Inner Work ( LJ 7/86) and We ( LJ 2/1/84), uses three literary archetypes: Don Quixote (simple, two-dimensional man); Hamlet (complex, four-dimensional man); and Faust (complete, four-dimensional man). As a result of modern education and urbanization, Johnson posits, Western man is no longer simple; yet he lacks self-determination and therefore is trapped. The insights found here seem applicable to universal self-fulfillment and provocation (e.g., what significance does Faust's victory over the devil hold for men in these AIDS-ridden, economically troubled times?). Also, where Bly's book demands action, Johnson's is purely cerebral and more interesting to readers familiar with classic literature.<br><i>- David Nudo, New York</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Murder in the Crooked House (Pushkin Vertigo)</h2><p><b>A fiendish <b>LOCKED ROOM MYSTERY</b> from the Japanese master of the genre.<br><br>Never before available in English.<br><br>By the author of the acclaimed <i>Tokyo Zodiac Murders</i>.</b><br><br>The Crooked House sits on a snowbound cliff overlooking icy seas at the remote northern tip of Japan.

In his encyclical <i>Praise Be to You </i>(<i>Laudato Si'</i>), Pope Francis challenges all people to praise and thank God for his glorious creation and to work together to safeguard her.</p><p>Popes Benedict XVI, John Paul II, and Paul VI addressed key themes regarding stewardship of God's creation, but Francis is the first to devote an entire encyclical to the subject. The encyclical takes its name from Saint Francis of Assisi's Canticle of the Creatures, which depicts cre�ation as "a sister with whom we share our life and a beautiful mother who opens her arms to embrace us". Pope Francis declares, "This sister now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her."</p><p>Francis calls for an "integral ecology" based on what Pope Saint John Paul II called an "ecological conversion"&#x2015;a moral transformation linking the proper response to God for the gift of his creation to concern for justice, espe�cially for the poor. He challenges people to understand ecology in terms of the right ordering of the fundamen�tal relationships of the human person: with God, oneself, other people, and the rest of creation.</p><p>Francis examines such ecological concerns as pollu�tion, waste, and what he calls "the throwaway culture". Climate, he insists, is a common good to be protected. He explores notions such as sustainability from a Judeo-Christian perspective. The loss of biodiversity and the unequal distribution of resources, largely caused by the consumerism and excessive individualism of the wealthi�er nations, threaten the good order of creation, he writes. While valuing technology, he rejects efforts to repudiate the natural order, including the moral law inscribed in human nature. He cautions against an overreliance on science to solve ecological problems and emphasizes the need for openness to God.</p><p>Expounding the biblical tradition regarding creation and redemption in Christ, Francis stresses man's subordi�nation to God's plan. He insists on the primacy of the human person in creation and rejects treating it as if it were "divine", yet he traces the roots of the ecological crisis to man's self-centeredness and the rise of prac�tical relativism. Without rejecting political changes, he implores people to change their hearts and their ways of life.</p></p><p><p><b>Pope Francis</b> (Jorge Mario Bergoglio), is the first Jesuit and the first Latin American to be elected to the chair of Peter.

De Lubac traces the origin of 19th century attempts to construct a humanism apart from God, the sources of contemporary atheism which purports to have &#34;moved beyond God.&#34; The three persons he focuses on are Feuerbach, who greatly influenced Marx; Nietzsche, who represents nihilism; and Comte, who is the father of all forms of positivism. He then shows that the only one who really responded to this ideology was Dostoevsky, a kind of profit who criticizes in his novels this attempt to have a society without God. Despite their historical and scholarly appearance, de Lubac&#39;s work clearly refers to the present. As he investigates the sources of modern atheism, particularly in its claim to have definitely moved beyond the idea of God, he is thinking of an ideology prevalent today in East and West which regards the Christian faith as a completely outdated.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Perfect Stranger: A Novel</h2><p><b>A masterful follow-up to the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>All the Missing Girls</i>&#x2014;the gripping story of a journalist who sets out to find her missing friend, a woman who may never have existed at all. &#x201c;Think: <i>Luckiest Girl Alive</i>, <i>The Girl on the Train</i>, <i>Gone Girl</i>&#x201d; (<i>TheSkimm</i>).</b><br><br>When Leah Stevens&#x2019; career implodes, a chance meeting with her old friend Emmy Grey offers her the perfect opportunity to start over.

From the front porch, our house had large sliding glass doors that led directly to the living room and kitchen, a hallway beyond with two bedrooms and a bathroom to share. The main door was at the other end of the hall and faced the woods, like the house had been laid down with the right dimensions but the wrong orientation.<br> <br>Probably the nicest thing I can say about the house was that it&#x2019;s mine. But even that&#x2019;s not exactly true. It&#x2019;s my name on the lease, my food in the refrigerator, my glass cleanser that wipes the pollen residue from the sliding glass doors.<br> <br>The house still belongs to someone else, though. The furniture, too. I didn&#x2019;t bring much with me when I left my last place. Wasn&#x2019;t much, once I got down to it, that was mine to take from the one-bedroom in the Prudential Center of Boston. Bar stools that wouldn&#x2019;t fit under a standard table. Two dressers, a couch, and a bed, which would cost more to move than to replace.<br> <br>Sometimes I wondered if it was just my mother&#x2019;s words in my head, making me see this place, and my choice to be here, as something less than.<br> <br>Before leaving Boston, I&#x2019;d tried to spin the story for my mother, slanting this major life change as an active decision, opting to appeal to her sense of charity and decency&#x2014;both for my benefit and for hers. I once heard her introduce me and my sister to her friends: &#x201c;Rebecca helps the ones who can be saved, and Leah gives a voice to those who cannot.&#x201d; So I imagined how she might frame this for her friends: My daughter is taking a sabbatical. To help children in need. If anyone could sell it, she could.<br> <br>I made it seem like my idea to begin with, not that I had latched myself on to someone else&#x2019;s plan because I had nowhere else to go. Not because the longer I stood still, the more I felt the net closing in.<br> <br>Emmy and I had already sent in our deposit, and I&#x2019;d been floating through the weeks, imagining this new version of the world waiting for me. But even then, I&#x2019;d steeled myself for the call. Timed it so I knew my mother would be on her way to her standing coffee date with The Girls. Practiced my narrative, preemptively preparing counterpoints: I quit my job, and I&#x2019;m leaving Boston. I&#x2019;m going to teach high school, already have a position lined up. Western Pennsylvania. You know there are whole areas of the country right here in America that are in need, right? No, I won&#x2019;t be alone. Remember Emmy? My roommate while I was interning after college? She&#x2019;s coming with me.<br> <br>The first thing my mother said was: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember any Emmy.&#x201d; As if this were the most important fact. But that was how she worked, picking at the details until the foundation finally gave, from nowhere. And yet her method of inquiry was also how we knew we had a secure base, that we weren&#x2019;t basing our plans on a dream that would inevitably crumble under pressure.<br> <br>I moved the phone to my other shoulder. &#x201c;I lived with her after college.&#x201d;<br> <br>A pause, but I could hear her thoughts in the silence: You mean after you didn&#x2019;t get the job you thought you&#x2019;d have after graduation, took an unpaid internship instead, and had no place to live?<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you were staying with . . . what was her name again? The girl with the red hair? Your roommate from college?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Paige,&#x201d; I said, picturing not only her but Aaron, as I always did. &#x201c;And that was just for a little while.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; she said slowly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not asking for your permission, Ma.&#x201d;<br> <br>Except I kind of was. She knew it. I knew it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come home, Leah. Come home and let&#x2019;s talk about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her guidance had kept my sister and me on a high-achieving track since middle school. She had used her own missteps in life to protect us. She had raised two independently successful daughters. A status I now seemed to be putting in jeopardy.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, what,&#x201d; she said, changing the angle of approach, &#x201c;you just walked in one day and quit?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re doing this why?&#x201d;<br> <br>I closed my eyes and imagined for a moment that we were different people who could say things like Because I&#x2019;m in trouble, so much trouble, before straightening my spine and giving her my speech. &#x201c;Because I want to make a difference. Not just take facts and report them. I&#x2019;m not doing anything at the paper but stroking my own ego. There&#x2019;s a shortage of teachers, Mom. I could really make an impact.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but in western Pennsylvania?&#x201d;<br> <br>The way she said it told me everything I needed to know. When Emmy suggested it, western Pennsylvania seemed like a different version of the world I knew, with a different version of myself&#x2014;which, at the time, was exactly what I needed. But my mother&#x2019;s world was in the shape of a horseshoe. It stretched from New York City to Boston, swooping up all of Massachusetts inside the arch (but bypassing Connecticut entirely). She was the epicenter in western Massachusetts, and she&#x2019;d successfully sent a daughter to the edge of each arch, and the world was right and complete. Any place else, in contrast, would be seen as a varying degree of failure.<br> <br>My family was really only one generation out from a life that looked like this: a rental house with shitty plumbing, a roommate out of necessity, a town with a forgettable name, a job but no career. When my father left us, I wasn&#x2019;t really old enough to appreciate the impact. But I knew there existed a time when we were unprepared and at the whim of the generosity of those around us. Those were the limbo years&#x2014;the ones she never talked about, a time she now pretends never existed.<br> <br>To her, this probably sounded a lot like sliding backward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great teachers are needed everywhere,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>She paused, then seemed to concede with a slow and drawn-out &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hung up, vindicated, then felt the twinge. She was not conceding. Great teachers are needed everywhere, yes, but you are not that.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t mean it as an insult, exactly. My sister and I were both valedictorians, both National Merit Scholars, both early admissions to the college of our respective choice. It wasn&#x2019;t unreasonable that she would question this decision&#x2014;especially coming out of thin air.<br> <br>I quit, I had told her. This was not a lie, but a technicality&#x2014;the truth being that it was the safest option, for both the paper and me. The truth was, I had no job in the only thing I&#x2019;d trained in, no foreseeable one, and no chance of one. The truth was I was glad she had given me the blandest name, the type of name I&#x2019;d hated growing up. A girl who could blend in and never stand out. A name in a roster anywhere.<br> <br>EMMY&#x2019;S CAR STILL WASN&#x2019;T back when I was ready to leave for school. This was not too unusual. She worked the night shift, and she&#x2019;d been seeing some guy named Jim&#x2014;who sounded, on the phone, like he had smoke perpetually coating his lungs. I thought he wasn&#x2019;t nearly good enough for Emmy; that she was sliding backward in some intangible way, like me. But I cut her some slack because I understood how it could be out here, how the calm could instead feel like an absence&#x2014;and that sometimes you just wanted someone to see you.<br> <br>Other than weekends, we could miss each other for days at a time. But it was Thursday, and I needed to pay the rent. She usually left me money on the table, underneath the painted stone garden gnome that she&#x2019;d found and used as a centerpiece. I lifted the gnome by his red hat just to double-check, revealing nothing but a few stray crumbs.<br> <br>Her lateness on the rent was also not too unusual.<br> <br>I left her a sticky note beside the corded phone, our designated spot. I wrote RENT DUE in large print, stuck it on the wood-paneled wall. She&#x2019;d taken all the other notes from earlier in the week&#x2014;the SEE ELECTRIC BILL, the MICROWAVE BROKEN, the MICROWAVE FIXED.<br> <br>I opened the sliding doors, hit the lights at the entrance, rummaged in my bag for my car keys&#x2014;and realized I&#x2019;d forgotten my cell. A gust of wind came in through the door as I turned around, and I watched the yellow slip of paper&#x2014;RENT DUE&#x2014;flutter down and slip behind the wood stand where we stacked the mail.<br> <br>I crouched down and saw the accumulated mess underneath. A pile of sticky notes. CALL JIM right side up but half covered by another square. A few others, facedown. Not taken by Emmy after all but lost between the wall and the furniture during the passing weeks.<br> <br>Emmy didn&#x2019;t have a cell because her old one was still with her ex, on his phone plan, and she didn&#x2019;t want an easy way for him to trace her. The idea of not owning a cell phone left me feeling almost naked, but she said it was nice not to be at anyone&#x2019;s beck and call. It had seemed so Emmy at the time&#x2014;quirky and endearing&#x2014;but now seemed both irrational and selfish.<br> <br>I left the notes on the kitchen table instead. Propped them up against the garden gnome. Tried to think of how many days it had been since I&#x2019;d last seen her.<br> <br>I added another note: CALL ME.<br> <br>Decided to throw out the rest, so it wouldn&#x2019;t get lost in the shuffle.</p><h2>Bring Your Brain to Work: Using Cognitive Science to Get a Job, Do it Well, and Advance Your Career</h2><p><p><b>To succeed at work, first you need to understand your own brain</b></p><p>If you're in a job interview, how should you think about the mindset of the interviewer?

Ahl has used a version of Virgil's ancient hexameter, a swift-moving six-beat line varying between twelve and seventeen syllables, to reproduce the original poetry in a thrillingly accurate and engaging style. This is an <em>Aeneid</em> that the first-time reader can grasp and enjoy, and whose rendition of Virgil's subtleties of thought and language will enthrall those already familiar with the epic. Unlike most translators, Ahl has chosen to retain Virgil's word-play, the puns and anagrams and other instances of the poet's ebullient wit. "Like Shakespeare and the Greek tragedians, Virgil grasped that humor and earnestness are not mutually exclusive in art any more than they are in life. One should read the <em>Aeneid</em> not in solemn homage, but for enjoyment." Enhanced by Elaine Fantham's Introduction, Ahl's comprehensive notes and an invaluable indexed glossary, this lively new translation brings readers closer to the original and the myriad enjoyments to be found there.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

It also examines herbal medicine today in the traditional Chinese apothecary, the Indian ayurvedic system, homeopathy, and Native American medicine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Balancing the mystical with the practical, author Wolf Storl explains how to become an herbalist, from collecting material to distilling and administering medicines. He includes authoritative advice on herb gardening, as well as a holistic inventory of plants used for purposes both benign and malign, from herbs for cooking, healing, beauty, and body care to psychedelic plants, witches&#x2019; salves for opening alternative realities, and poisonous herbs that can induce madness or cause death.

When they accurately predicted the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI one full year in advance, even naming the very month and year he would step down, global shockwaves raised compelling questions regarding why the Vatican has an advanced telescope perched atop Mt. Graham in Arizona (USA) where the Jesuits admit they are monitoring something approaching Earth. Authors Horn and Putnam visited the mountain and spoke with the astronomers. After their second report was published in Exo-Vaticana, the pope s top astronomer took to the airwaves (and on the Vatican Observatory website) in an attempt to explain the role that he and other church astronomers are playing in regard to the LUCIFER device on Mt. Graham, as well as their developing doctrines concerning extraterrestrial life and the impact it may soon have on planet Earth s religions (Christianity in particular). Then, in the third book by Horn and Putnam, On the Path of the Immortals, the authors set out with cameras and field investigators to unearth their most astonishing discovery yet: Mt. Graham is a portal the Native Americans who fought the Vatican and NASA told them a gateway to another dimension. And, as the Vatican knows and the authors uncovered, it is not the only one.

For three years, members of the Oyneb Shabes worked in secret to chronicle the lives of hundereds of thousands as they suffered starvation, disease, and deportation by the Nazis. Shortly before the Warsaw ghetto was emptied and razed in 1943, the Oyneg Shabes buried thousands of documents from this massive archive in milk cans and tin boxes, ensuring that the voice and culture of a doomed people would outlast the efforts of their enemies to silence them.

Lw�w produced Meyer Balaban, Philip Friedman, and Natan Gelber. Tarn�w was the home of Isaac Schiper and Salo Baron. Rafael Mahler, Ringelblum's lifelong friend, and Artur Eisenbach, his future brother-in-law, grew up in the small town of Nowy Sacz. They all came from a region that differed in many important ways from Jewish Lithuania and Congress Poland, just across the Russian border. They were the products of a cultural milieu that combined excellent Polish education with strong Jewish nationalism. Habsburg rule was milder, educational opportunities greater. During Ringelblum's formative years, Galician Jewry was undergoing a fateful process of redefinition and self-examination. Emanuel Ringelblum was born in Buczacz (Bichuch in Yiddish) in eastern Galicia on November 21, 1900. Once a part of Poland, the province passed under Habsburg rule in 1772 before it became part of the new Polish republic in 1918-19. The area of Buczacz was also known as Podolia. The Buczacz of Ringelblum's childhood was a pretty town, surrounded by wooded hills and nestled in a bend of the river Strypa. High up overlooking the town was an old empty castle, "der puster shlos," where, according to tradition, the legendary Polish King Sobieski staged a daring ambush of Tatar invaders. On Saturday afternoons young couples would explore the countless tunnels that lay underneath the castle.1 The great Hebrew writer Shmuel Yosef Agnon&#x2014; Ringelblum's cousin&#x2014;grew up in Buczacz and left a beautiful description of his birthplace in the story "B'tokh iri" (In my town). 2 Dominating Buczacz was the splendid Ratusz, or town hall, an imposing baroque landmark built by Prince Nikolai (Miko_aj) Potocki in the eighteenth century. Buczacz had long belonged to the Potockis, one of the greatest of the Polish landowning families. Like other Polish magnates the Potockis&#x2014;eager to further their economic interests&#x2014;went out of their way to attract Jews.3 From the very beginning Buczacz was a predominantly Jewish town. In 1870, 68 percent of the population had been Jewish (6,077 out of 8,959 inhabitants); in 1900, the year Ringelblum was born, there were 6,730 Jews out of a total of 11,755 inhabitants&#x2014;or 57.3 percent of the population. The surrounding countryside was heavily Ukrainian. Buczacz was a poor town, like most towns in Galicia, with little industry. Jews dominated trade, mainly in grains and other agricultural products, but the low purchasing power of the peasant population severely limited economic possibilities. In time, the growth of both Ukrainian and Polish cooperative movements would deal another heavy blow to the economic position of the Jews. Dim economic prospects served as a powerful stimulus to emigration. Many Jews, including Jacob Freud, Sigmund Freud's father, left for Vienna. Shmuel Yosef Agnon, the future Nobel Prize winner, also left the town at a young age. Emanuel Ringelblum's father, Fayvish, a grain merchant, was respected, if not particularly prominent in the Jewish community and regarded himself as a maskil, a follower of the Jewish Enlightenment. Someone who met him during World War I recalled that "he looked like an ordinary Jew [folksmensh], a 'Jewish Jew' [yidishlekher yid]. He was dressed half-Jewish, half-European, without earlocks but with a short, red beard."4 Ringelblum's mother Munie, n�e Heler, died when he was twelve years old. In later years he would use her name as a nom de plume. Fayvish was determined that his children&#x2014;two sons and two daughters&#x2014;have a solid education in both Jewish and secular subjects. 5 As a child, Ringelblum studied in a modern heder (Jewish elementary school)&#x2014;a so-called heder metukan6&#x2014;and attended one year of the local Polish gymnasium before the family fled the Russian invasion in 1914. He also participated in a Zionist youth organization led by the dynamic Zvi Heller, who later emigrated to Israel. Natan Eck, who worked with Ringelblum in the Warsaw Ghetto, recalled that Ringelblum loved to tell stories of his childhood in Buczacz.7 Although he never returned to live in his hometown, he would often refer to his childhood there. In some ways Buczacz was like other Jewish small towns in Eastern Europe, and the young Emanuel grew up in an atmosphere rich in Jewish folk culture. But in other ways Buczacz was different. While East Galicia and Podolia were Hasidic strongholds&#x2014;the native grounds, after all, of the Ba'al Shem Tov&#x2014;Buczacz stood out as a bastion of the Haskala. Hasidim were a minority,8 and their relative weakness made it easier for strong Zionist organizations to grow in Buczacz before World War I. A third of the students in the local Polish high school were Jews, and they received a solid grounding in classics and exposure to Polish and European high culture. Many of the high school's most popular teachers were Jews.9 The town boasted a large Baron de Hirsch primary school, set up to give Jewish students both a general and vocational education. Some of its graduates went on to the gymnasium, others entered trades. By the beginning of the century, several alumni who had remained in Buczacz had already formed a fledgling Jewish labor movement.10 Although young Jews received a Polish education, they did not become young Poles. The Galician Jewish intelligentsia, however acculturated, was surrounded by a strong and vibrant Yiddish-speaking folk culture nourished in many places by deep-rooted Hasidic traditions. Buczacz Jews&#x2014;like other Galician Jews&#x2014;considered themselves lucky that they did not live across the border in Russia. They did not have to worry about stiff quotas barring them from high schools and universities. The Polish political elite had built up a network of Polish high schools that freely admitted Jewish students, making Polish the preferred language of educated Galician Jews. The Galician "gymnasium" instilled discipline and orderly work habits. Meanwhile, across the Russian border, thousands of desperate Jewish young people either went abroad to study or wasted countless years trying to pass university entrance exams. Many, embittered and alienated, would join the revolutionary movement. In Galicia, only finances&#x2014;not legal quotas&#x2014;stood between Jewish youth and the great universities of the empire. They could choose between a German education in Vienna or a Polish university in Krakow or Lemberg (Lw�w). Many attended both. A university degree did not guarantee prosperity; there were too few jobs for university graduates. (Less fortunate Jews on the other side of the Russian border liked to swap barbed jokes about the ubiquitous&#x2014;and often impecunious&#x2014;"doctors" who inundated the tiniest Galician shtetl.) Unquestionably, however, this university-educated Galician- Jewish intelligentsia, with its overlay of European culture, imbued Galician Jewry with a special character. In the early years of the Polish Republic, many Galician Jews, including Emanuel Ringelblum, would stream to Warsaw. There, in the new capital of the new state, they used their excellent Polish and superior educational credentials to good advantage as teachers in state schools for Jewish children, Jewish secondary schools, and administrators in various Jewish institutions. Unlike their brothers from Lithuania, Russia, and Congress Poland, Gali-cian Jewry had also benefited from the more congenial political climate of the Habsburg Empire. By the 1860s, they had won legal emancipation. Long before the first Duma elections in Russia in 1906, Habsburg Jews were participants in the political process. When Ringelblum was growing up in Buczacz, the town had a Jewish mayor, Berish Shtern, and a Jewish police chief.11 Jews in Galicia felt more secure than Russian Jewry, with a relatively free press and a rich organizational life, with more legal safeguards in place. Pogroms were rarer, the resonance of revolutionary politics much weaker. Indeed Ringelblum would later recall how moved he was when, as a young man in Warsaw in 1920, he first came into contact with young Jews from Congress Poland who had participated in battles against the tsar and who had a revolutionary tradition.12 Nevertheless, Galician Jewry saw its share of political struggle and confrontation, especially during the decade preceding World War I. Although the Jews enjoyed the political and educational benefits of Habsburg rule, clouds loomed on the horizon, and the years of Ringelblum's childhood witnessed far reaching changes that transformed Galician Jewry. The same reforms that brought emancipation to the Jews in the 1860s also placed political power in Galicia in the hands of the Polish nobility. Most middle-class Jews shifted their allegiance from German culture to Polish. Many Jewish leaders also preached assimilation: Jews should become "Poles of the Mosaic persuasion." But by the time Ringelblum was born, support for the assimilationists had largely collapsed in Galician Jewish society. Even as they spoke Polish at home and sent their children to Polish schools, many educated Galician Jews keenly resented growing Polish anti-Semitism and the refusal to repay Jewish cultural loyalty with full acceptance. According to some memoirs, by the eve of World War I the social gulf between Jews and Poles, especially in East Galicia, had grown enormously. Polish and Jewish high school students would study together but go their separate ways after school.13 By the turn of the century much of the non-Hasidic Galician Jewish middle class was turning to Zionism. Zionism in Galicia had less to do with immediate emigration to Palestine than with new definitions of Jewishness. Galician Zionism, which largely conducted its business in refined Polish, symbolized Jewish nationalism, a Jewish self-consciousness that could easily coexist with the adoption of non-Jewish culture. Galicia would anticipate a characteristic development of the interwar Jewish life in Poland: growing acculturation that at the same time rejected assimilation. As tensions escalated between Ukrainians and Poles, especially in Eastern Galicia, Jewish nationalism also became an expedient way of declaring neutrality and avoiding a potentially dangerous crossfire. Aware that they had no hope of attracting Jews to Ukrainian culture, Ukrainians preferred Zionism and Jewish nationalism to overt Jewish identification with Polish culture and aims. In turn, Polish nobles preferred Jewish assimilationists or pliant Hasidic rebbes who denied separate Jewish national status and obeyed the dictates of the Polish leadership. (In Buczacz, they had long enjoyed a cozy relationship with Berish Shtern, the Jewish mayor.) In the decade before World War I, two major events sparked Jewish- Polish confrontation and encouraged an intense process of national redefinition: the new 1907 election law and the 1910 census. The 1907 law, which expanded the suffrage, changed the rules of the political game. Zionists now saw their chance to make major gains, and the Polish elite had more reason to fear losing control over a Jewish vote that often held the balance between Poles and Ukrainians. In Buczacz and elsewhere, the elections of 1907 led to bitter charges of Polish intimidation and vote tampering. The 1910 census saw heavy Polish pressure on Jews to declare Polish as their mother tongue and thus bolster Polish claims to predominance in the area; the census authorities refused to recognize Yiddish as an option. In a test case of modern Jewish politics, many Galician Jews, even those who were actually Polish-speaking, demonstratively defied the census commission and declared Yiddish as their mother tongue. In an ironic twist, certain Yiddish-speaking Hasidic rebbes, who detested modern Jewish nationalism, urged their followers to declare themselves as Polish speakers! All over Galicia, including Buczacz, the census battle became the symbol of Jewish independence from Polish tutelage.14 By the time Ringelblum entered the Buczacz gymnasium, relations there between Polish and Jewish students had become quite tense.15 One by-product of the 1910 census fight was a renewed interest in modern Yiddish culture among a small but growing minority of the Jewish intelligentsia. They could count for support on a nascent Jewish labor movement. The Jewish labor movement was not as strong in Galicia as in Russia; Galicia had barely industrialized. But echoes of the revolutionary battles across the border in Russia certainly raised the prestige of the Bund and the Poalei Tsiyon, the party founded by Ber Borochov in 1906. On the eve of World War I both these parties had well-established organizations in the region.16 For workers and students who wanted to combine radical Marxism, Zionism, and Yiddishism, an ideal vehicle was the emerging Poalei Tsiyon. Several students had already broken away from a larger Zionist youth organization, the Tseirei Tsiyon, and joined Borochov's party. Among the new leaders of the Galician Poalei Tsiyon were two university students who in later years would have an important influence on Ringelblum's life: Natan Buchsbaum and Isaac Schiper. When Buchsbaum joined the party, he knew no Yiddish at all. He laboriously taught himself the language and began addressing meetings of tailors and store clerks, whom the party was trying to organize. By 1914 the party was conducting its meetings in Yiddish. Schiper became not only one of the most important Polish-Jewish historians but also a key leader of the Galician Poalei Tsiyon before World War I. Born in Tarn�w in 1884, Schiper already spoke Yiddish well and had begun to take an active interest in Yiddish culture when he read Ber Borochov's seminal article, "The Tasks of Yiddish Philology," which appeared in 1913. In December of that same year, Schiper wrote an article in the Lemberg party newspaper, Der Yidisher Arbeter, that elaborated on and explained Borochov's arguments in favor of Yiddish. On the eve of World War I, therefore, Galician Jewry had undergone a marked process of political self-definition. Assimilation as an ideology had collapsed; political changes in the Habsburg Empire hastened the modernization of Jewish politics. For the first time Jewish labor parties were becoming a factor in Jewish politics. A sizable Jewish intelligentsia had emerged, well educated in Polish and German but identified with Jewish nationalism. If Galician Jewry lacked the revolutionary traditions of Russian Jewry, it did possess a large reservoir of well-educated cadres who would play a major role in Jewish political and cultural activity in the interwar Polish republic. This was the milieu of Ringelblum's formative years. SANZ When the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914, Emanuel Ringelblum had completed one year of the Polish classical gymnasium in Buczacz. A heavy Russian offensive in September 1914 broke the Austrian lines and headed into Podolia. Horrified by stories of maltreatment of Jews by the Russians, thousands of refugees began to flee westward. The Ringelblum family joined the stream of refugees. After a brief stay in nearby Kolomeja, the Ringelblums settled in Nowy Sacz (Nay Sanz or Sanz in Yiddish), a town on the Dunajec River in Western Galicia. Uprooted from his home at the age of fourteen, Ringelblum had to make a painful adjustment to a new life. The family faced desperate poverty. Fayvish, who had remarried, barely eked out a living in the town marketplace. The family of six crowded into a tiny house. One of Ringelblum's new friends, the then fifteen-year-old Mendl Naygroshl, visited Ringelblum many times and remembered a "poor, depressing place: a small kitchen, a small room and every bit of space taken up with beds. . . . You could feel a quiet sadness in the house, the poverty that had taken hold and the loneliness of uprooted peop...</p><h2>Mistress of the Empire (Empire Trilogy, Bk. 3)</h2><p>The world on the other side of the rift:&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelewan, a land seething with political intrigue and deadly conspiracies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the opulent panoply of <i>Daughter Of The Empire</i> and the dazzling pageantry of <i>Servant Of The Empire</i> comes the resounding conclusion to the Empire trilogy.<br>Besieged by spies and rival houses, stalked by a secret and merciless brotherhood of assassins, the brilliant Lady Mara of the Acoma faces the most deadly challenge she has ever known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fearsome Black Robes see Mara as the ultimate threat to their ancient power.&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of allies who will join her against them, Mara must travel beyond civilization's borders and even into the hives of the alien cho-ja.&nbsp;&nbsp;As those near and dear to her fall victim to many enemies, Mara cries out for vengeance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on all of her courage and guile she prepares to fight her greatest battle of all--for her life, her home, and the Empire itself.</p><p>"I enjoyed [<i>Mistress Of The Empire</i> ] enormously . . .

With great compassion and understanding, he offers telling examples of how humanity must walk a conscious middle way between the two tempting powers of Lucifer and Ahriman. He describes the incarnation of Lucifer in the third millennium before the Christ event, out of which flowed not just the wisdom of paganism, but also the conscious intellect we enjoy today. Ahriman, on the other hand, is shown approaching human beings through such phenomena as materialism, nationalism, and literalism, all in preparation for his incarnation in the third millennium. <br><br> Keep in mind, however, that these two powers do not work separately; rather, they are working increasingly together. Our task as human beings is to hold them in balance, continually permeating one with the other. Steiner tells us that &#x201c;Lucifer and Ahriman must be regarded as two scales of a balance, and it is we who must hold the beam in equipoise. How can we train ourselves to do this? By permeating what takes ahrimanic form within us with a strongly luciferic element.&#x201d; To accomplish this task we need a new, more conscious inner life.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

It happens so regularly you can count on it. Every June and January, starry-eyed and eager craftspeople invade their friendly local yarn supplier bearing fresh-off-the-press copies of the needlework periodicals that are blossoming with elegant and enchanting visions of projects to make, sweaters to create&#x2014;and potential disasters. Part of the knitting instructor&#x2019;s job is to help people understand the techniques necessary for them to complete the project they have chosen to make. Simply by seeing hundreds of garments both in progress and completed means we knitting instructors become painfully aware of what knitted fabric will and will not do. And after fitting and adjusting hundreds of articles on hundreds of different kinds, sizes, and shapes of people, we have become absolutely certain of what shapes knitting will take and what shape the human body will not. So every June and January (and often in between) I gather these starry-eyed and eager knitters around the worktable, and using their new periodicals as texts, I hold an impromptu class called &#x201c;You Can Always Tell What Is Wrong with the Garment by the Way the Model Is Posed.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a fun class with lots of giggles, ah-has, and exclamations such as, &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s why it never looked right!&#x201d; Listen in and join the class. I&#x2019;ll assign you our homework before we begin: Pick up your newest periodical filled with knitting designs and look at the photos. That&#x2019;s all. Just look&#x2014;and then think about them. Your homework is to look for yourself, think for yourself, and learn to recognize for yourself when something is not quite right. With as many patrons around me as I can gather, the lesson starts. Pointing at the cover, I say: Be aware&#x2014;beware&#x2014;of any garment whose model is not standing in a normal relaxed position. A good-looking, well-designed, properly proportioned garment can easily stand scrutiny. It looks good straight on and on straight. The model could just stand there and you&#x2019;d want to make the garment, sure in the knowledge of what the finished product would look like. A sweater worth making has nothing to hide. But what if the model is posed in an exaggerated way so you can&#x2019;t see the neckline or the wrists or both shoulders? The picture above is a perfect example (see fig. 1.1). You can only see one shoulder. The neckline is covered up with a very attractive blouse. But you aren&#x2019;t making the blouse&#x2014;you are making the sweater, and you haven&#x2019;t the foggiest idea how the neck is finished or where it is supposed to sit on the human body. One wrist is covered by a bracelet; the other is hidden in shadow. The model is posed as if she were stretched out in front of a roaring fire, all cuddly and warm. Heaven help her, though, if she&#x2019;d tried to get up and walk to a window to look out. Her sweater would probably drop to her knees, judging by the way the bottom of it is hidden in folds. You&#x2019;d have no idea whether it was a case of a tiny model and a sweater too big for her, or if the waistline was intended to be the hemline. You really need to know what you&#x2019;re making, what it&#x2019;s supposed to look like, and how it&#x2019;s intended to fit before you begin. If you don&#x2019;t know these things, how will you know if you are doing it right? If you can&#x2019;t see the whole garment, don&#x2019;t make it! Next, we all agree, is a picture of a striking handbag (see fig. 1.2). The model is posed in a knit dress, of course, yet this large handsome shoulder bag is the focal point. If this is a knitting book whose instructions are trying to sell the yarn for a knit dress, why cover it up with a luscious handbag? A veteran of misleading photos of knitting projects, whom my class calls Grandma, immediately spots the inconsistencies. &#x201c;She carries that handbag because the shoulders don&#x2019;t fit. Just look at the picture&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t see the left shoulder at all. It&#x2019;s turned away and out of the picture. The right shoulder is covered up with the strap of the bag. What&#x2019;s more, the bag covers her waistline. If the dress looked good, they wouldn&#x2019;t have to hide it. Now, if it had raglan sleeves and if the waist were brought in somehow, it&#x2019;d be good-looking. But they can&#x2019;t fool an old lady like me with a huge handbag.&#x201d; She has learned to separate the fiction from the reality. Younger, less experienced knitters quickly learn to detect the inconsistencies between the photograph and the finished product. One points out that the dress is vertically striped and that all the stripes are the same width from top to bottom. &#x201c;So where did the width at the waist and bust go?&#x201d; A retired salesclerk responds with a laugh. &#x201c;Well, honey, in the old days when I was selling dresses, if it was too big around the waist or in the bust, we&#x2019;d just hold it together in the back while the customer was looking in the mirror. That&#x2019;s the old clothespin-in-the-back trick.&#x201d; The knitters in the class know that they can&#x2019;t walk around with a clothespin in the back, and they won&#x2019;t make this &#x201c;cannot work&#x201d; project. On the next page of the magazine is a study of a sweet young thing in marvelous golden tones (see fig. 1.3). Her hair is spun gold, the sweater tawny gold, and the chair golden brown. We can&#x2019;t tell where one begins and the other ends. It is all one golden glow. The class oohs at the lovely illusion. It is a great mood photograph. But as far as information about the sweater pattern it is trying to sell, it is a big loss. I ask the class, &#x201c;Honestly now, can you visualize yourself in the sweater? Where will the neckline fit around your neck? Where do the shoulders rest? Does it have shoulders at all? Where and how does the garment end? If you make it, you may find out&#x2014;to your dismay!&#x201d; The class ah-has. We flip to the next page. You could order the jewelry from the next photo and know exactly what you would be getting (see fig. 1.4). The sweater, however, is another matter. The class has caught on and learned the lesson well. They ask me to forget the jewelry and tell them about the sweater. I begin. &#x201c;It has a collar.&#x201d; &#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; they ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but it has sleeves.&#x201d; &#x201c;What kind?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell.&#x201d; &#x201c;How long are they?&#x201d; they ask. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but I don&#x2019;t think that they are long,&#x201d; I answer. &#x201c;How long is the sweater? Where does it end?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell, but I can tell you that if I try to tuck a sweater into a gathered skirt, I look like a barrel.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t they show the shoulders?&#x201d; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t want to make the sweater, but I do want to know how I can order the jewelry.&#x201d; Because we can&#x2019;t order the jewelry, we turn the page (see fig. 1.5). &#x201c;That&#x2019;s cute.&#x201d; &#x201c;Which one, the sweater or the hat?&#x201d; &#x201c;Both!&#x201d; &#x201c;How can you tell the sweater&#x2019;s &#x2018;cute&#x2019;?&#x201d; &#x201c;What is it made of?&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see. Get a magnifying glass.&#x201d; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s made of some sort of fuzzy stuff.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather make the hat.&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ve got to admit the hat is a real showstopper.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are there instructions for it?&#x201d; &#x201c;Look on page seventy-eight.&#x201d; &#x201c;No hat instructions.&#x201d; &#x201c;How about the sweater?&#x201d; &#x201c;It has instructions.&#x201d; No one can tell anything about the sweater; there isn&#x2019;t even a graphic drawing. Granny says, &#x201c;If the sweater was worth making they&#x2019;d show it to us. It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;attraction by association.&#x2019; Because the hat is pretty, you just naturally think the sweater is pretty, too.&#x201d; We turn to yet another page, still looking for something to make (see fig. 1.6). &#x201c;A coat&#x2014;I need a short car coat.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted a knitted car coat.&#x201d; &#x201c;Too bad they didn&#x2019;t put that one on a slender model&#x2014;she looks dumpy.&#x201d; &#x201c;She is skinny. Look at her cheekbones and neck. It&#x2019;s the coat that&#x2019;s dumpy and huge.&#x201d; We look at the instructions. They say &#x201c;small, medium, and large.&#x201d; There is no indication of how small &#x201c;small&#x201d; is, nor how large &#x201c;large&#x201d; is. There are no drawings, charts, or measurements included in the instructions. We don&#x2019;t know if it was merely that there was only a slender model available for a large coat when the picture was taken or if the garment was intended to be large and dumpy. Since we don&#x2019;t know what size to make, we can&#x2019;t make the car coat either. Since this book was first published in 1986, manufacturers, magazine and pattern book publishers, and designers have changed their ways. Photos picture the finished garment in a truer light; schematics and drawings of the pieces of the article are usually shown; measurements of both the completed parts and the article are often given. What a change! If this chapter in the original edition made any difference, I&#x2019;m pleased. In the same way we go through the whole periodical, the students getting wiser all the time. Never again will they make a garment they cannot see clearly. Never a garment that has places covered up. They also learn to look at the article with a critical eye, to see that the item fits the human body as it exists and not be taken in by a pattern written strictly by the book. God was not consulted about the variety of human shoulders to be covered. It&#x2019;s not easy, but if you recognize the problem, it can be solved. Try to picture yourself in the garment. Would your broad shoulders fit in those set-in sleeves, or do you need a raglan or drop sleeve for the sweater to fit well and look good?&#x2020; In pictures, the pr...</p></p><h2>Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions and Death&#39;s Duel</h2><p>John Donne (1572-1631) is best known as the greatest English metaphysical poet. But there was another dimension to Donne's life and writing that, if less well known, is no less profound and beautiful. <br><br>Born into an aristocratic Catholic family, Donne joined the Church of England at the age of twenty-one out of fear of persecution. At the age of forty-three, he gave up his preoccupations with secular prestige and devoted himself utterly to religion. It was eight years later when, battered with fever, the deaths of his beloved wife, several of his children, and many dear lifelong friends, he composed <b>Devotions upon Emergent Occasions</b>. There is both trauma and great drama in this extended meditation on the meaning of mortality, the possibility of salvation, and the true nature of the passage of eternal life. With a new introduction by poet and biographer Andrew Motion, one of the most revered books of Christian devotion speaks to us again of the higher aspirations of man and the always-present possibility of a relationship with God. <br><br>This long out of print edition also contains Donne's last sermon, "Death's Duel" as well as the short colorful biography of him written by his contemporary Izaak Walton.</p><p><i>Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions and Death's Duel</i>, one of the handsome series of Vintage Spiritual Classics, contains a rich collection of extraordinary writings, any one of which would be worth the price of the whole book. Andrew Motion's clear, accessible, entertaining, and erudite introduction explains the situation of both <i>Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions</i>--written in 1624, when Donne was feeble with a fever that doctors believed might kill him--and <i>Death's Duel</i>--Donne's final sermon at St. Paul's Cathedral, preached only a month before his death at age 59. Also included is Izaak Walton's <i>The Life of Dr. John Donne</i>, a spry and penetrating biography of the poet, written in 1640. And then there is the meat: both <i>Devotions</i> and <i>Death's Duel</i> show Donne at his very best--theatrical, humble, faithful, and doubting all at once. This is a book of severe and joyful mortality. Here is a foretaste from <i>Devotions</i>: "Death is in an old man's door, he appears and tells him so, and death is at a young man's back, and says nothing.... There is scarce anything that hath not killed somebody; a hair, a feather hath done it; nay, that which is our best antidote against it hath done it; the best cordial hath been deadly poison." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>British metaphysical poet JOHN DONNE (1572-1631), renowned for his satires on English society, wrote this prose work in the latter part of his life, after he became an Anglican priest. <p>In addition to the writer's 1624 collection of meditations, debates with God, and prayers on the human condition--particularly earthly physical sickness and health--this volume contains the 1631 work "Death's Duel," a sermon said to be his own funeral oration, which he preached shortly before his own death. </p><p>Readers of 17th-century literature, religious devotionals, and ponderers of human mortality are sure to find something profound in this fascinating, famous work.</p></p><h2>Urn Burial (Phryne Fisher Mysteries, 8)</h2><p><p><strong>"Another Down Under adventure that's definitely a cut above." &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></strong><em></em></p><p>The redoubtable Phryne Fisher is holidaying at Cave House, a Gothic mansion in the heart of Australia's Victorian mountain country. But the peaceful surroundings mask danger. Her host is receiving death threats, lethal traps are set without explanation, and the parlour maid is found strangled to death. What with the reappearance of mysterious funerary urns, a pair of young lovers, an extremely eccentric swagman, an angry outcast heir, and the luscious Lin Chung, Phryne's attention has definitely been caught. Her search for answers takes her deep into the dungeons of the house and into the limestone Buchan caves. What will she find this time?</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Those who like their mysteries bold and spicy will appreciate the latest adventure of 1920s heroine Phryne Fisher--the most erotic to date. Although Greenwood often describes loves scenes between Phryne and her handsome Chinese lover, Lin Chung, this time the action doesn't stop there. In fact, while taking a holiday at Cave House in Australia's Victorian mountain country, Phryne has her hands full. The racist innkeeper's wife has separated Phryne from Lin, who is placed at the other end of the house. To console herself, Phryne dabbles with a sexy young man. And while stealing a heated moment with Lin in the dark boathouse, Phryne hears a male couple obviously engaged in the same activity right near them. Aside from all the hanky-panky, a mystery does occur: the inn's owner is targeted by an enemy--first with notes, then with lethal traps. And someone is leaving funeral urns for Phryne--what are they trying to tell her? Another Down Under adventure that's definitely a cut above. <i>Jenny McLarin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reveals how problems between managers and employees, and between companies or divisions within a larger corporation, stem from an inability to conduct a successful dialogue.</p><p>Modern conversation is a lot like nuclear physics, argues William Isaacs. Lots of atoms zoom around, many of which just rush past each other. But others collide, creating friction. Even if our atomic conversations don't turn contentious, they often just serve to establish each participant's place in the cosmos. One guy shares a statistic he's privy to, another shares another fact, and on and on. Each person fires off a tidbit, pauses to reload while someone else talks, then fires off another. In <i>Dialogue and the Art of Thinking Together</i>, Isaacs explains how we can do better than that.<p> Isaacs, who is Director of the Dialogue Project at MIT and a consultant to major corporations, including AT&amp;T and Intel, believes that corporate, political, and personal communication can be a process of thinking together--as opposed to thinking alone, and then trying to convince others of our positions by refusing to consider other opinions, withholding information, and ultimately getting angry and defensive. This is not pie-in-the-sky, let's-all-hold-hands-and-sing stuff. He offers concrete ideas for both listening and speaking; for avoiding the forces that undermine meaningful conversation; for changing the physical setting of the dialogue to change its quality. The outcome, he says, can be quite different from the traditional winner-loser structure of arguments and debates. Businesses can make more reasoned decisions, and thus earn more money. Governments can create peaceful resolutions to seemingly intractable problems. (For example, Isaacs cites secret conversations between Nelson Mandela and F.W. de Klerk in South Africa, which occurred over a number of years, while Mandela was still under arrest and led to a new framework for their country.) And, although this is a book primarily geared toward managers, even married couples can learn a few new ways to communicate. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p><b>William Isaacs</b> is the founder of Dialogos, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

But how are we to glorify God for the rest of our lives? The Bible reveals that God has laid before every Christian two infinite journeys which we are to travel every day: the internal journey of growth into Christlike maturity, and the external journey of worldwide evangelism and missions. <em>An Infinite Journey</em> is a road map for the internal journey, laying out how we are to grow in four major areas: knowledge, faith, character, and action.<br></p><p>In <em>An Infinite Journey</em>, we&#x2019;ll learn how God grows us in knowledge, faith, character, and action. We&#x2019;ll also discover that spiritual knowledge constantly feeds our growing faith, faith will transform our character, our transformed character will result in an array of actions more and more glorifying to God, and our actions will feed our spiritual knowledge. This upward spiral will lead us to become more and more like Jesus Christ in holiness. And not only will this book help us understand Christian growth in detail, it will also give us a passion to grow every day for His glory.<br>&#x201c;Rarely have I read a book on sanctification that is simultaneously serious and fresh, at once reflective and accessible.

It is a marvelous treatment of the doctrine of sanctification and a call to grow in Christlikeness. It is biblically grounded, theologically rich, and practical in application. It felt like I was reading a modern Puritan. Do not be hesitant to delve into this treasure because of its size. The precious nuggets of truth that leap from its pages will make the investment a wise one indeed. --Dr. Daniel L. Akin President Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><h2>Nose to Tail Eating: A Kind of British Cooking</h2><p>Fergus Henderson caused something of a sensation when he opened his restaurant St John in London in 1995. Set in a former smokehouse near Smithfield meat market, its striking, high-ceilinged white interior provides a dramatic setting for food of dazzling boldness and simplicity. As signalled by the restaurant&#39;s logo of a pig (reproduced on the cover of Nose to Tail Eating) and appropriately given the location, at St John the emphasis is firmly on meat. And not the noisettes, fillets, magrets and so forth of standard restaurant portion-control, all piled up into little towers in the middle of the plate: Henderson serves up the inner organs of beasts and fowls in big, exhilarating dishes that combine high sophistication with peasant roughness. Nose to Tail Eating is a collection of these recipes, celebrating, as the title implies, the thrifty rural British tradition of making a delicious virtue of using every part of the animal. This new edition, beautifully redesigned, comes with an introduction by Anthony Bourdain.</p><p>&#39;A fantastic book, wonderful stories with nostalgic and inspiring recipes -an essential book for honest cooks&#39; Jamie Oliver &#39;His cooking and recipes are a joy&#39; Nigel Slater &#39;A cult masterpiece&#39; Anthony Bourdain &#39;Nose to Tail Eating is a book I&#39;ve raided so many times as a chef. Every recipe is wonderful, and it&#39;s one of the most concisely humorous cookbooks that I&#39;ve ever come across. Fergus has a sense of humour and an ability to self-edit that I&#39;m as envious of as I am his cooking skills. And Jason Lowe is one of my favourite food photographers&#39; Tom Norrington-DaviesFergus Henderson trained as an architect before becoming a chef.

Compiled and written by one of modern Christianity&#39;s greatest thinkers, this book highlights Scripture passages on the central doctrines of Christianity - such as creation, man&#39;s sin and God&#39;s grace, the person and work of Christ, future events - and briefly explains how each passage supports the biblical teaching on that particular theme. It&#39;s all right here. Laid out simply. So you can see for yourself what the Bible says - in God&#39;s own words. This volume also contains Two Contents, Two Realities, Schaeffer&#39;s essay on the four things Christians need to make an impact in the current age. Together these two works serve to show the coherence and credibility of the Scriptures and their relevance to the critical issues in your life.</p><p>Recognized internationally for his work in Christianity and culture, Francis A.

It is a way of life. Randy Harris invites you not just to understand these great teachings but to live them in ways you never before imagined.<p>This new book is a training tool for people who want to live the way of Jesus. Centered on the entire contents of the Sermon on the Mount found in Matthew 5-7, it unpacks the sermon in hard-hitting, easy-to-understand, and practical ways.</p><p>G. K. Chesterton said Christianity has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and not tried. Many people today view the Sermon on the Mount this way. They simply believe the teaching is too hard and give up in exasperation and guilt or confusion. The single most important interpretive key for the sermon, says Randy Harris, is to believe that Jesus really intended for us to live these teachings.</p><p>Martin Luther said the Sermon on the Mount is so di!cult that we can only fall on the grace of God. The teachings are indeed difficult, and we can only fall on the grace of God, but this doesn't mean the teachings cannot become a necessary guide for living the way of Jesus. The Sermon on the Mount, says Harris, is livable and this book is a guide to the greatest teaching of all time that will change your life forever.</p></p><p>This new book is a training tool for people who want to live the way of Jesus.

He earned his B.A. and M.A. degrees at Columbia in 1925 and 1927 and went on to study medieval French and Sanskrit at the universities of Paris and Munich. After a period in California, where he encountered John Steinbeck and the biologist Ed Ricketts, he taught at the Canterbury School, then, in 1934, joined the literature department at Sarah Lawrence College, a post he retained for many years.

In <em>Jamie's Italy</em>, he travels this famously gastronomic country paying homage to the classic dishes of each region and searching for new ideas to bring home. The result is a sensational collection of Italian recipes, old and new, that will ensure that Italy's influence reaches us all.<br><br> Italy has inspired Jamie Oliver throughout his career. His ambition has always been to travel across the country on a quest to capture the very essence of Italian cooking--and to produce the best and simplest Italian cookbook for everybody anywhere to enjoy.<br><br> <em>Jamie's Italy</em> is the result of that journey--and it's a land of plenty. As well as providing more than 120 brand-new recipes for everything from risotto to roasts and spaghetti to stews, structured as traditional trattoria menus, Jamie takes you all over Italy to cook with and learn from the real masters of Italian cuisine: the locals. Far from the standard "lemons and olives" version of Italian cooking, <em>Jamie's Italy</em> is a cookbook by the people for the people. From Sicily to Tuscany, it's about the local fishermen, family bakers, and, of course, the "Mamas," sharing their recipes and the tips that have gone into their cooking for generations. But it's not only mouthwatering food that Jamie brings back home: it's also the spirit that makes cooking and eating absolutely central to family life, whichever part of Italy you're in.<br><br> Bursting with the warmth and hospitality of real family life, this is both a superbly accessible cookbook and a unique travelogue and diary, in which you'll find the authentic flavor of Italy and the people who live there. If you love quality food prepared with genuine passion--you'll never want to leave <em>Jamie's Italy</em>.</p><p><strong>Jamie Oliver</strong> grew up in his parents' country pub, the Cricketers in Clavering, where he started cooking at the age of eight, before studying at London's Westminster Catering College. He then went on to work with some of the top chefs in England namely Antonio Carluccio at the Neal Street Restaurant and Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers at the River Caf�. The author of such popular titles as <em>The Naked Chef, Jamie's Kitchen, Jamie's Italy</em>, among others, he has written for the <em>Saturday Times</em>, served as Food Editor at <em>GQ</em> and <em>Marie Claire</em> magazines, and hosted the popular television show <em>The Naked Chef</em>. He is twenty-nine and lives in London with his wife Jools and their daughters, Poppy and Daisy.Oliver, television's <i>Naked Chef</i>, may have been born in Southend-on-Sea, but he turns out to have an Italian soul in this collection of recipes from all over the Boot. As an outsider, Oliver has great reverence for the traditions of Italy, and he offers some surprisingly deep insight about how a lack of choice and a massive working-class population have kept those traditions alive. This is no sugar-coated fairy tale, however: Oliver doesn't hesitate to get down-and-dirty, as in a description of Palermo street food served by hand from a "chain-smoking, dirty-looking bloke," and he cogently explains why he insisted on including a "graphic and gruesome" photo of a slaughtered sheep. Indeed, Oliver enthusiastically encourages British and American readers to familiarize themselves with foods less common in their home countries such as rabbit. Nonna Giusy's Fish with Couscous reflects the African influences of Sicily, and Altamura Pea Soup with fresh peas and broken spaghetti perfectly represents the Italian genius for making something out of almost-nothing. Desserts include a simple Pear Sorbet with grappa. Candid photos such as one of Oliver's mentor's father, a 96-year-old who cooks for himself every day reinforce the personal feel of this collection, and the impression that Oliver has a deep affinity for Italian food, no matter his British roots. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I don&#x2019;t want to hear another detail about your upcoming nuptials. You&#x2019;ve turned into a groomzilla, Michel. Your obsession over the venue and your tux and the guest list is driving everyone in this kitchen insane.&#x201d; She pointed at a sous chef, who&#x2019;d paused in the act of chopping onions to wipe his eyes with a dish towel. &#x201c;That man is weeping, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He always cries when he&#x2014;&#x201d; the head chef of The Boot Top Bistro began.</p><p>&#x201c;It started with the tulips, right?&#x201d; Olivia directed her remark at the sous chef. &#x201c;Michel&#x2019;s supposed to be creating the finest cuisine of coastal North Carolina, but his souffl�s are falling and his sauces are burning while he frets over whether to have blush-colored tulips, hot pink tulips, or lavender tulips at his reception.&#x201d; She turned back to Michel. &#x201c;I will take a meat cleaver to the next tulip you bring into this restaurant, do you hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>Michel opened his arms in a gesture of helplessness. &#x201c;I want everything to be perfect!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Last summer you said that you wanted a simple, intimate affair. But your plans have grown grander and more absurd by the month. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if Shelley was ready to call off the whole thing.&#x201d;</p><p>At the mention of his fianc�e&#x2019;s name, Michel&#x2019;s petulant look instantly vanished, and he smiled widely. &#x201c;She told me that I could have all the pomp and circumstance I wanted. Unlike you, she understands that I&#x2019;ve waited my whole life for this day and I want&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;White doves and stretch limos?&#x201d; Olivia sighed. &#x201c;This is about you and Shelley. It&#x2019;s a joining of two lives. A chance for the people who love you to share in your happiness. You don&#x2019;t need a chocolate fountain for a wedding to be beautiful. You only need you, the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with, and a few carefully chosen words.&#x201d;</p><p>Michel swiveled to face the rest of the kitchen staff. &#x201c;Have I gone off the deep end?&#x201d;</p><p>They nodded in unison.</p><p>&#x201c;Has my food suffered?&#x201d;</p><p>The line cook exchanged a nervous glance with the sous chef. Michel had a fiery temper and it was clear that no one wanted to say that his cooking hadn&#x2019;t been up to its usual standards. But Michel caught the furtive glance and instantly hid his face in his hands. &#x201c;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> I have betrayed my art. And for what? Monogrammed napkins? Embossed invitations?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And tulips,&#x201d; Olivia added. She put a hand on Michel&#x2019;s forearm and gave it an affectionate squeeze. She was used to his theatrics, but this wasn&#x2019;t a good time for one of his meltdowns. They needed to review the possible menus for the historical society benefit dinner before showing them to the president. &#x201c;You can stop looking around for the perfect venue. The Boot Top is your kingdom, Michel. Its kitchen is your beating heart. Have the reception here. I&#x2019;m sure your colleagues would be delighted to prepare the food for your wedding feast.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone wearing a chef&#x2019;s jacket or apron murmured his or her agreement.</p><p>Michel looked at them and sniffed. &#x201c;Really? You&#x2019;d do that for me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course we would,&#x201d; Olivia answered on behalf of her staff. &#x201c;That just leaves the cake.&#x201d;</p><p>Michel brightened. &#x201c;Shelley and I always planned on making our own cake. I&#x2019;ll do the baking and she&#x2019;ll do the decorating. After all, no one can hold a candle to her when it comes to sweet confections.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia thought of the Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day display she&#x2019;d seen in the front window of Decadence, Shelley&#x2019;s desserterie. Candy coins wrapped in gold foil spilled from a cauldron of solid chocolate. There was a forest of four-leaf-clover lollipops, marshmallow clouds, and a rainbow of candy fruit slices. Fondant leprechauns perched atop grasshopper cupcakes or cartwheeled across the frosted surfaces of cr�me de menthe brownies. &#x201c;Shelley is truly gifted,&#x201d; Olivia said. &#x201c;And so are you. Can we talk about the menu for the benefit now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only if you promise to come with me to the First Presbyterian Church before I get started on the dinner service,&#x201d; Michel said. &#x201c;I promised to swing by with a copy of our program.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t want a church wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>Michel shrugged. &#x201c;<i>Maman </i>does. And since I am her only son, I did what she asked.&#x201d; Straightening, Michel barked out orders to the kitchen staff and they jumped to obey. Scooping the bridal magazine off the counter, he held it aloft as if it were a torch. &#x201c;I am back, my friends. And I apologize for being so distracted. That&#x2019;s over now. You have my word as a gentleman and a chef. Spring is upon us and we will be busier than ever. We must uphold the reputation of The Boot Top Bistro. We must dazzle every diner!&#x201d;</p><p>Smiling, Olivia grabbed her head chef by the elbow. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk in the bar and then we&#x2019;ll stop by the church. Which Saturday did you book?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I chose a Monday,&#x201d; Michel said. &#x201c;The Boot Top is closed on Mondays. You won&#x2019;t lose any business and neither will Shelley. She and I will take Tuesday off and be back in the kitchen on Wednesday.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia poked her head into her office and saw that her standard poodle, Captain Haviland, was fast asleep. She smiled indulgently and then led Michel through the dining room into the bar. &#x201c;Why rush back to work?&#x201d; Olivia asked. &#x201c;What about your honeymoon?&#x201d;</p><p>Michel sank into one of the leather club chairs. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go when the tourist season is over. Mid-October maybe. I want to bring Shelley to Paris. We can visit our old haunts from culinary school and then travel to the Riviera, visiting vineyards as we make our way south. It&#x2019;s past time we updated The Boot Top&#x2019;s wine list.&#x201d; Michel gestured at the polished wood bar. &#x201c;Not that Gabe isn&#x2019;t the finest tender in town, but his palate isn&#x2019;t sophisticated enough to be the restaurant&#x2019;s sommelier.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, the sacrifices you make for your job,&#x201d; Olivia said teasingly and placed a folder on the small table dividing her chair from Michel&#x2019;s.</p><p>Michel reached out and grabbed her hand. He tapped the platinum band embedded with dark sapphires on her ring finger, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the only person in the room who should be making wedding plans. And yet I hear nothing of yours. Why not? What are you waiting for,<i> ma ch�rie</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>Pulling her hand free, Olivia straightened the printed menus in the folder. &#x201c;Mine will be a very quiet affair. Justice of the peace and a champagne toast. That&#x2019;s all. There&#x2019;s not much to organize.&#x201d;</p><p>Michel fixed her with an intent stare. &#x201c;Then why aren&#x2019;t you already married? Are you cohabiting, or is the chief still living out of a drawer? I know how much you treasure your independence, Olivia. But when you said &#x2018;yes,&#x2019; you gave up your old life.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia felt her cheeks grow warm. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated. When he&#x2019;s on duty, the chief needs to be close to town, so he stays at his place. My house is too far out. If there&#x2019;s a police emergency&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She shrugged, letting Michel reach his own conclusions. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t like to spend the night in his house. His wife still has a presence there. She picked out the wallpaper and the towels, the dishes and the furniture. It&#x2019;s her home. It&#x2019;s a monument of their life together. Not to mention that it&#x2019;s too far from the water.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t have our resident mermaid living away from the beach. Your scales would dry out.&#x201d; He gazed at her fondly.</p><p>Olivia shoved a printed menu under Michel&#x2019;s nose. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s focus on these menus now, shall we?&#x201d;</p><p>An hour later, Olivia pulled her Range Rover into a private lot belonging to the First Presbyterian Church and opened the car door for Haviland. As he jumped out of the backseat and Michel alighted from the front, Olivia studied the Gothic Revival architecture, taking in its blocks of somber gray stone, pointed arches, and towering spire. It was one of the most imposing buildings in all of Oyster Bay.</p><p>A jarring mechanical noise erupted from inside the church. Michel winced and Haviland started barking.</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a jackhammer?&#x201d; Michel shouted.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;re tuning the organ,&#x201d; Olivia yelled.</p><p>Haviland&#x2019;s barking increased in volume, and he retreated several steps. Olivia laid her hand on the poodle&#x2019;s head and tried to calm him, but he was clearly discomfited by the noise.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m putting Haviland back in the car,&#x201d; she told Michel. &#x201c;Go on. I&#x2019;ll catch up.&#x201d;</p><p>As soon as Haviland was safely inside the Range Rover, he stopped barking and stretched across the backseat. Olivia gave him a chew stick, promised she wouldn&#x2019;t be long, and crossed the parking lot. Drawing closer to the church, she noticed several commercial vans and a pickup parked near the building. A man in a hard hat came out of a door in the church&#x2019;s west wall and began rummaging through an aluminum toolbox in the bed of the pickup. After retrieving a pair of safety goggles and a crowbar, he disappeared into the church again.</p><p>Olivia found Michel in the sanctuary, standing next to a man wearing khakis and a blue dress shirt. Mercifully, the hammering sound had stopped.</p><p>Michel introduced her to Pastor Jeffries.</p><p>&#x201c;Please call me Jon,&#x201d; the man said, offering Olivia his hand. His grip was warm and firm. Olivia liked both his handshake and his friendly brown eyes. They reminded her of Haviland&#x2019;s. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we haven&#x2019;t met before,&#x201d; the pastor said. &#x201c;Ours is a small town, but our paths have yet to cross.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m surprised because you&#x2019;re very active in community projects. Your name pops up all the time in the paper.&#x201d;</p><p>Michel put an arm around Olivia&#x2019;s shoulders. &#x201c;My boss wrangles money from Oyster Bay&#x2019;s upper crust. You work in the trenches, Pastor. You probably aren&#x2019;t involved with the same charities.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suspect you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; the pastor said amiably. &#x201c;Until now. Miss Limoges and I are both supporting the upcoming historical society benefit. Not only is the historical society our next-door neighbor, but the society&#x2019;s founding family, the Drummonds, have been devoted patrons of this church for the past century.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia let her gaze wander up the center aisle to the altar, and then over the polished pews to the stained glass windows. The colored glass was cracked in places and coated with a film of grime, making it hard for the light to pass through. Watery yellows and dull oranges spotted the sanctuary&#x2019;s red carpet, and Olivia wondered if the windows could withstand the force of the work being done in the room to the left of the vestibule.</p><p>Pastor Jeffries followed the direction of her gaze. &#x201c;I was just telling Michel that we&#x2019;re in the middle of a minor construction project. At least, it started out as a minor project. The plan was to turn the cloakroom into a comfortable space for prayer and counseling, but as often happens during a renovation, the contractor and his crew encountered problems. Water damage, rotted floorboards, issues with the wiring. They&#x2019;ve dug right down to the foundation stone.&#x201d; His eyes slid toward the large brass cross on the altar. &#x201c;I spent half the morning praying that there wouldn&#x2019;t be any more surprises.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pastor Jeffries!&#x201d; a man called from the doorway dividing the vestibule from the chapel. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better come look at this. We found something buried in the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And people think the Lord lacks a sense of humor.&#x201d; The pastor winked, told his guests he&#x2019;d return in a moment, and strode down the center aisle.</p><p>Michel sighed. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t pictured drop cloths and plaster dust as part of my wedding day d�cor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the job will be completed by then.&#x201d; Olivia ran her fingers along the back of a polished pew. The sanctuary smelled of beeswax and lilies. Overall, it was a pleasant space. The walls were a soft white, velvet cushions in a deep cranberry hue covered the pews, and the entire room was illuminated by rows of brass chandeliers suspended from the high ceiling. Olivia swiveled, taking in the second-floor balcony and the gleaming organ pipes. Everything was simple, elegant, and clean. Aside from the Easter lilies grouped around the altar, the only adornment in the entire sanctuary was the windows. &#x201c;This is the oldest church in Oyster Bay,&#x201d; she told Michel. &#x201c;Think of all the couples that have walked up this aisle. All the music that&#x2019;s been played. How many secret hopes and fears have been whispered into folded hands. This place is redolent with history.&#x201d;</p><p>Sinking into a pew, Michel frowned. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s gloomy, but my mother will love it. It speaks of Old World Europe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not gloom. It&#x2019;s patina.&#x201d; Olivia wandered over to the windows on the east wall and studied the Biblical scenes. Though she&#x2019;d attended only a handful of church services throughout her life, she recognized most of the scenes. She didn&#x2019;t tarry long before Mary and Joseph, the nativity, or Christ cradling a lamb. After noting more cracked glass and sagging lead in the John the Baptist window, she moved to the west wall. She liked the Daniel in the lion&#x2019;s den window and paused to take in the detailed faces of the slumbering felines. Again, she saw damage to the glass, lead, and putty.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d think these would be more important than the cloakroom renovation,&#x201d; she murmured to herself and walked by a window featuring a young boy holding a harp. In the next scene, she admired how the glass artist had used pieces of green, orange, and red glass to create a burning bush. But she didn&#x2019;t linger, finding that she was inexplicably drawn to the last window.</p><p>This one, which was in the worst condition of all, portrayed a woman and child. The child, a girl with an ageless face, gazed forward. Her expression was both hopeful and serene. Most of her body was enfolded in the woman&#x2019;s gown, and as Olivia edged closer, she realized that it wasn&#x2019;t a gown but a feathered wing curving protectively around the girl. The angel was in profile, her eye closed and her cheek pressed against the girl&#x2019;s cheek. Olivia could almost hear her whispering words of comfort into the child&#x2019;s ear. The more she stood and stared, the more the angel looked like her mother.</p><p>Hesitantly, Olivia placed her fingers against the glass and traced one of the white flowers hanging near the angel&#x2019;s outstretched hand. The girl&#x2019;s small hand rested in the angel&#x2019;s cupped palm, and Olivia had the urge to lay her own hand on top of theirs. She wanted to go where they were going, to see what lay beyond the curtain of dogwood blossoms.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a guiding angel,&#x201d; Pastor Jeffries said from behind Olivia, causing her to start. &#x201c;Sorry. Didn&#x2019;t mean to creep up on you.&#x201d; He flashed her a sheepish smile. &#x201c;This is my favorite window.&#x201d;</p><p>Olivia pointed at the angel. &#x201c;Her face is completely two-dimensional, and yet she reminds me so much of my mother.&#x201d;</p><p>The pastor nodded. &#x201c;Everyone recognizes a special woman in her. A mother, sister, daughter, wife, nurse, teacher.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can the windows be restored?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At great cost, yes. We&#x2019;ll have to raise more funds, but I have faith that we&#x2019;ll get the money. The capital campaign has been eaten up by all the problems we&#x2019;ve run across with our current project, so it&#x2019;s fortunate that we have a devoted benefactor.&#x201d; Pastor Jeffries didn&#x2019;t s...</p></p><h2>A Meeting at Corvallis (A Novel of the Change)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A major work by an authentic master of alternate history.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Booklist (Starred Review)</i></b><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In the tenth year of the Change, the survivors in western Oregon live in a world without technology.

DeSalvo advises her readers to explore their creative process on deeper levels by getting to know themselves and their stories more fully over a longer period of time. She writes in the same supportive manner that encourages her students, using the slow writing process to help them explore the complexities of craft. <i>The Art of Slow Writing</i> is the antidote to self-help books that preach the idea of fast-writing, finishing a novel a year, and quick revisions. DeSalvo makes a case that more mature writing often develops over a longer period of time and offers tips and techniques to train the creative process in this new experience. </p><p>DeSalvo describes the work habits of successful writers (among them, Nobel Prize laureates) so that readers can use the information provided to develop their identity as writers and transform their writing lives. It includes anecdotes from classic American and international writers such as John Steinbeck, Henry Miller, Virginia Woolf and D. H. Lawrence as well as contemporary authors such as Michael Chabon, Junot Diaz, Jeffrey Eugenides, Ian McEwan, and Salman Rushdie. DeSalvo skillfully and gently guides writers to not only start their work, but immerse themselves fully in the process and create texts they will treasure.</p></p><p><p><b>Louise DeSalvo</b> (1942-2018) was the multi-award-winning author of such memoirs as <i>Vertigo</i>, <i>Breathless</i>, and <i>Crazy in the Kitchen: Food, Feuds and Forgiveness in an Italian American Family</i>. She was also a renowned feminist scholar and essayist who wrote about such literary figures as D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Virginia Woolf. Her book <i>Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work</i> was named one of the most important books of the twentieth century by the <i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books</i>.</p><p>A professor of English, Louise taught creative writing and literature at Hunter College where she implemented the school&#x2019;s MFA in Memoir program, and she wrote several books on creative writing including <i>Writing as a Way of Healing: How Telling Our Stories Transforms Our Lives</i> and <i>The Art of Slow Writing: Reflections on Times, Craft, and Creativity</i>.</p><p>1.</p> <p>Learning How to Work at Writing</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I remember a meltdown I had in college when I was writing an essay. You were given an assignment. You had to hand in a perfect paper on a due date. There were no opportunities for revision, no comments on a draft to help you improve.</p> <p>So there I was, sitting at my desk. I&#x2019;d reel a sheet of erasable paper into my typewriter and begin. And I&#x2019;d expect myself to do everything at once&#x2014;present a coherent argument; write an organized essay in syntactically correct, perfectly punctuated prose.</p> <p>I was writing about Dostoyevsky, my favorite author. I knew what I wanted to say. But I had no notes, no draft. I had an outline, but it felt like a straitjacket. I kept having new insights as I wrote, but instead of tossing my outline, I tossed away my pages. When I wrote an incoherent sentence, I&#x2019;d tear the paper out of the typewriter and begin anew.</p> <p>Halfway through the night, I was so muddled, so incapable of working, that I began crying and couldn&#x2019;t stop. A friend calmed me down and sat beside me while I did the best I could. But the paper was a disaster. &#x201c;You write primer English,&#x201d; the professor commented. Afraid of making a mistake, short on time, I&#x2019;d simplified my writing and my argument.</p> <p>I wanted to be a writer. But if this was what writing was like, I couldn&#x2019;t do it&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t have the necessary skills. I didn&#x2019;t know it was all right to start anywhere. That most writers compose more than one draft. That it was impossible to do everything at once. But that&#x2019;s how I thought writers wrote, and no one&#x2014;not my professors, not the books I read about literature (we were steered away from biography)&#x2014;told us anything different about how writers worked. The closest I came to seeing a writer&#x2019;s process was when I typed a few drafts of a collection by a poet who taught at my college.</p> <p>Now, when I teach the craft of memoir, I invite Kathryn Harrison to my class to describe how she wrote <i>The Mother Knot (</i>2004), her memoir describing her tangled relationship with her mother. My students are eager to pen their first full-length work; still, many want to rush the process and don&#x2019;t yet know how to work at writing. Hearing Harrison discuss the many stages of her work provides them with important information about how to write their own memoirs.</p> <p>Harrison arrived in class with a stack of manuscripts&#x2014;ten drafts of <i>The Mother Knot</i> that she composed from autumn 2002 through summer 2003. She began the work as a long essay; she realized she was writing a book in the seventh draft. Seeing that pile of drafts was an important learning experience for my students. As one said, &#x201c;I realized that if it took Harrison that many drafts, it&#x2019;d take me that long, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>Because Harrison knows she&#x2019;ll work through many drafts, she gives herself permission to write badly at first. Although the book&#x2019;s skeleton&#x2014;having her mother&#x2019;s body exhumed and cremated&#x2014;existed in the first draft, Harrison deleted or shortened self-indulgent material that wasn&#x2019;t germane to the book. Other subjects&#x2014;her anorexia, for example&#x2014;that she raced through, she had to later develop. In time, Harrison deepened the meaning of what breast-feeding and her mother&#x2019;s sadism meant to her. And what she&#x2019;d reported&#x2014;her mother&#x2019;s behavior, conversations with her own therapist&#x2014;she later revised into scenelets and full-fledged scenes.</p> <p>Harrison took time between drafts&#x2014;a few days, a month&#x2014;and that helped her understand how to fix problems. She often dealt with challenges one draft at a time&#x2014;how she presented character A, how she presented character B. In another draft, she focused on how she treated images of water that had been present early, refining and expanding them. In later drafts, she worked by association to fill in the blanks of her narrative.</p> <p>The structure of Harrison&#x2019;s work had been established from the beginning: a linear narrative combined with flashbacks in scenelets, scenes, or exposition. But until almost the last draft, Harrison didn&#x2019;t know how the memoir would end. From the first draft, it began with a scene of her finding frozen breast milk. She thought she&#x2019;d end with casting her mother&#x2019;s ashes into the water. But she intuitively wrote a scene describing her Quaker wedding, which, she realized, was a more apt resolution to the theme of how she came to terms with her mother&#x2019;s adverse effect upon her.</p> <p>Witnessing how Harrison wrote and revised <i>The Mother Knot</i> helped my students understand that it takes many drafts to create a work of art, that we can&#x2019;t tackle all our challenges at once, and that composing and revision proceed in stages. After Harrison&#x2019;s visit, we discussed the stages of the writing process.</p> <p>First, you imagine the work, think about it, and take notes about it, perhaps long before you actually begin writing. (Harrison, though, began the work immediately after a telephone conversation with the undertaker who would exhume her mother&#x2019;s body.)</p> <p>Second, once you start, you work provisionally, knowing you&#x2019;ll have many opportunities to get it right.</p> <p>Third, you work in stages, writing, revising, letting yourself learn what your subject is really about as you work.</p> <p>Fourth, you figure out order, structure, and image patterns late in the process, though you may have some ideas from the start. You revise accordingly.</p> <p>Fifth, you fine-tune the work, tightening where necessary, adding information your reader needs when necessary. You go through the work word by word, sentence by sentence, and paragraph by paragraph.</p> <p>Sixth, you don&#x2019;t show your work until late in the process. And then you revise again, based upon feedback. (After Harrison showed a draft to her editor, she deleted a hospital scene, material about her son, and revised again.)</p> <p>Whether we&#x2019;re beginning writers or beginning a new project, understanding that working <i>with</i> the stages of the writing process, rather than <i>against</i> it, can help our work immeasurably, as my students learned from Harrison&#x2019;s visit and her generosity in describing her composition of <i>The Mother Knot</i>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Louise DeSalvo</p></p><h2>Immortally Yours: An Argeneau Novel (An Argeneau Novel, 26)</h2><p><p><strong><em>Irresistible chemistry and thrilling suspense combine in this electrifying new installment in </em></strong><strong>New York Times<em> bestselling author Lynsay Sands&#x2019; Argeneau series...</em></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One hundred and twenty-five years is a long time to nurse a crush.

From anywhere in the world--from overflowing sewage in Cairo, from a war zone in Rwanda, from an energy-efficient office building in California, from a pig farm in China or North Carolina. "Preparedness demands understanding," writes Pulitzer-winning journalist Laurie Garrett, and in this precursor to <i>Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health</i>, she shows a clear understanding of the patterns lying beneath the new diseases in the headlines (AIDS, Lyme) and the old ones resurgent (tuberculosis, cholera). As the human population explodes, ecologies collapse and simplify, and disease organisms move into the gaps. As globalization continues, diseases can move from one country to another as fast as an airplane can fly.<p> </p><blockquote>While the human race battles itself ... the advantage moves to the microbes' court. They are our predators and they will be victorious if we, Homo sapiens, do not learn how to live in a rational global village that affords the microbes few opportunities.</blockquote><p> Her picture is not entirely bleak. Epidemics grow when a disease outbreak is amplified--by contaminated water supplies, by shared needles, by recirculated air, by prostitution.

He lives on Long Island, New York.</p>America is Under Attack <br> A bright morning sun lit a cloudless blue sky. America started its day. Highways filled with traffic. Railroads rumbled with trains. Airports roared with jetliners. Among the hundreds of planes rising into that flawless blue sky were two from Boston, one from Newark, New Jersey, and one from Washington, D.C. Among their ordinary passengers were nineteen deadly men. They were followers of Osama Bin Laden, leader of an organization known as al-Qaeda. The group hated America's power and influence. Bin Laden promised violence against America. The nineteen men had pledged their lives to fulfill that threat. At 8:00 AM on September 11, 2001, they acted. With knives, pepper spray, and threats of bombs, they stormed the four airliner cockpits and wrested control away from the pilots. The jets were no longer just ordinary airplanes; they were weapons. The planes banked away from their planned flight paths and headed for their targets. On one of the planes, a flight attendant managed to alert onthe-ground authorities to the hijacking. She reported, "Something is wrong ... We are flying very, very low." Before them loomed the World Trade Center on the lower tip of New York's Manhattan Island. Each skyscraping tower was just over 1,350 feet tall and boasted 110 floors. More than 14,000 earlybird workers had already arrived, a fraction of the 50,000 who worked there. At 8:46 AM, the plane slammed into the North Tower. Flying at 450 miles per hour, the jet exploded through floors 93 to 99. The earth shook. Debris and flames hurtled from the opposite side of the building. Fire Chief Joseph Pfiefer was out with a truck and his crew in lower Manhattan when he heard the plane approach. He looked up and watched the jet smash into the tower. "Everyone ... get in the rigs because we're going down there," he said. Inside the tower, an inferno of jet fuel shot down a thousand feet of elevator shaft to the lobby and lower levels. "I heard a roar," said police captain Anthony Whitaker, who had been standing his regular, early morning watch at the base of the tower. "I saw a gigantic fireball ... I turned ... and ran." The building suffered horrible damage. People on lower floors could escape down the stairs. But hundreds of others on higher floors were trapped by burning wreckage and ruined stairwells. Many used their cell phones to call for help--three thousand calls were made to the 911 emergency system in the ten minutes after the crash. Overloaded circuits made connections difficult. Trapped people were told to wait for help. Chief Pfiefer and his team marched into the North Tower and sent out the alarm for more firefighters. They and other rescue workers quickly arrived, sirens blaring. Emergency vehicles flooded lower Manhattan. Within seventeen minutes of the crash, a thousand fire, police, and rescue workers swarmed the World Trade Center. Many were off duty; they simply reported to the scene when they heard the news. Among the rescue workers arriving at the North Tower was Chief Pfiefer's brother Kevin, a lieutenant in the fire department. The two men shared a few moments together, then turned to their duties. The chief remained in the lobby to direct the arriving firefighters. His brother headed for the crash site. Two companies of firefighters were ordered up to the flaming wreckage ninety stories above. They entered a stairwell and began the thousand foot vertical climb. Each fire fighter carried more than 80 pounds of equipment. Without elevators, it would take more than an hour to reach the impact site. "We started up ... from the ground floor. We would take it ten floors at time [and] catch our breath," said a fire captain. "This way, we would have some energy to ... do whatever we were going to do when we got to the upper floors." The fire department's plan wasn't to fight the fire. "Fire [fighting] systems in the building were probably damaged and possibly inoperable ... So we determined early on, that this was going to be strictly a rescue mission. We were ... going to get people out, and then we were going to get out," said a fire chief. The fire department ordered everyone out of the building. A total tower evacuation had never been attempted before. It had never been practiced, nor even been planned. No one had imagined a catastrophe that would require it. Meanwhile, Captain Whitaker--the police captain who'd earlier dodged the fireball in the tower lobby--ordered a full evacuation of the World Trade Center, the collection of buildings that was home to the Twin Towers. Poor communications and a damaged public address system made it nearly impossible to broadcast the evacuation order. People in the buildings continued to receive mixed messages from emergency operators; sometimes to "stay put" and other times to "leave immediately." Some people left, others departed and returned. In the North Tower, the fire department even had trouble contacting their fire fighters as they climbed the stairs to the impact zone. Their handheld radios barely operated. Making and receiving orders was hit or miss. High on the 88th floor, Frank De Martini, the building's construction manager, hadn't heard anything from the rescue operation based in the lobby. He didn't even know about the plane crash; he thought someone had planted a bomb or that a mechanical room had exploded. His office was wrecked. The ceiling had collapsed, flames licked the walls, and smoke filled the air. Dazed people stumbled about. He surveyed the ruins, gathered a team, and went to work. First, De Martini discovered an open stairway and sent down more than twenty-five people who had been trapped. Among them was his eighty-nine-year-old co-worker Moe Lipson. "My heart was pumping harder than usual," Moe said. Then De Martini, along with co-worker Pablo Ortiz and others, made their way up to the 89th floor. They found more people trapped by debris and freed them, sending the rescued people down the stairwell. De Martini and Ortiz continued up toward an unknowable chaos, looking for more trapped survivors. The floors at the crash site were a tangle of burning wreckage. Smoke billowed across lower Manhattan. On the floors above the burning rubble, hundreds of people were trapped. Using phones and email, in voices sometimes calm and other times frantic, they sent the same message: We're stuck! Send help! Police helicopters flew close. "People were hanging out of the building, gasping for air," said a helicopter crew member. "There was no way of getting near anyone in a window ... we were helpless, totally helpless." Heavy smoke and intense heat from the fire made rescuing people from the roof impossible. Some of the trapped people jumped. Suddenly a helicopter pilot shouted, "There's a second plane!" Stanley Praimnath saw the second jet race straight at his 81st floor office in the South Tower. He dived under his desk, screaming. Everything exploded. Walls and ceilings collapsed. Part of the jet's wing jammed into a door. The overpowering stink of jet fuel made breathing difficult. But Praimnath was alive; the only survivor at the heart of the impact. The second hijacked jetliner had crashed through the 77th to 85th floors of the South Tower. Massive flames spewed from the tower. Wreckage rained down on the street. It was 9:03 AM, seventeen minutes after the strike on the North Tower. People now understood the earlier crash was not a freak accident but a deliberate attack. Despite the horrific crash, one stairwell in the South Tower remained intact. Unlike the North Tower, people above the crash had the means to escape to the street. In the chaos, however, many people would not find it. Firefighters scrambling into the South Tower discovered a working elevator that carried them to the 40th floor. From there, they climbed a stairwell. Passing them on the way down were escaping civilians. The lack of panic by the civilians impressed the firefighters. People patted the fire fighters' backs and wished them well. In return, the firefighters encouraged them for their long flight down. Below, one elevator screeched to a halt at the building's main lobby. It had plunged 900 feet before automatic safety brakes stopped it. The riders pried open the doors and escaped. In the North Tower, another elevator sat stalled and locked closed at the lobby. It had come to a halt when the plane struck. Chris Young, its lone occupant, knew nothing of the catastrophe around him. Firefighters going up couldn't hear his shouts and marched past him, unaware of his predicament. High above was another trapped elevator. From its intercom, the riders learned there had been an "explosion." The riders forced open the doors and discovered they had stopped in front of a wall. One of the passengers was a window washer. He began scratching the wall with the metal edge of his squeegee to make a hole. Dense smoke billowed off both towers. Falling wreckage hurtled to the ground. Despite the risk, hundreds of firefighters, police, emergency medical technicians, private security guards, and even workers from the neighboring hotel stationed themselves around the World Trade Center, tending to the injured and helping office workers flee. To avoid the debris raining down on the plaza outside the tower, they directed evacuees through neighboring buildings or through underground corridors. Thousands streamed away. At 9:37 AM 200 miles away from the disaster zone in New York, the military's headquarters in Washington, D.C., known as the Pentagon became the third target of the hijackers' attack. The jet swooped low and plowed into the building at ground level. The flaming impact nearly reached the center courtyard. "It was a loud roar ... The building shook ... Jet fuel poured into the corridors ... and ignited, taking all the oxygen out of the air," said an Army officer. "The heat inside was so hot, it felt like the sun kissing you," said a soldier. Rescuers raced to the scene. From exits everywhere, 20,000 people eventually evacuated the building. Back in New York, in the wreckage of the South Tower, Stanley Praimnath yelled, "Help! Help! I'm buried! Is anybody there?" Brian Clark was there. He had been fleeing his ruined office when he'd heard shouts. Clark and Praimnath clawed the rubble. Clark yanked the trapped man free, and the two fell to the floor in a hug. "I'm Brian," Clark said. "I'm Stanley," Praimnath said. The two men found a stairwell and headed down. Thousands of people escaped down the towers' stairwells. The injured, the old, the handicapped were helped by friends, by strangers. People shared drinks. A blind man came down with his guide dog. Two brothers trudged the stairwells: one, a firefighter, going up, the other, a businessman, coming down. They didn't meet. Not on the stairs were co-workers Ed Beyea and Abe Zelmanowitz. Beyea was paralyzed and in a wheelchair. There wasn't an elevator for him to escape. Zelmanowitz waited with his friend for rescue. There were eventually joined by Fire Captain William Burke. Together the three waited for available rescue workers to carry Beyea down. By 10:00 AM, lines of firefighters stretched all the way to the 54th floor in the North Tower. At the same time in the South Tower, one hard charging chief made it all the way to the impact zone on the 78th floor. Chief Orio Palmer used the elevator to travel forty stories and then raced up thirty-eight flights of stairs on foot. Hundreds of miles away, another kind of desperate action unfolded. The fourth hijacked plane was still in the air, creasing the Pennsylvania sky. By way of cell phone calls to the ground, passengers learned of the attacks in New York and Washington. The passengers decided they had to fight back. They stormed the cockpit. The hijacker pilot pitched and banked the plane to throw the passengers off balance. At 10:03 AM, the jet rolled onto its back and roared earthward. The passengers were still battling when the plane smashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile in New York, molten aluminum poured from the South Tower as the remains of the jetliner melted. Watching the disaster was a city building engineer, one of the many government officials who had rushed to the scene. Surveying the damage he warned fire department commanders that the tower was close to collapsing. The warning came too late: at 9:59 AM the South Tower came down. In ten seconds, the mammoth building was reduced to rubble. "It looked exactly like an avalanche coming down the street at you," a policeman said. It cleaved a neighboring hotel in two. Cars flew through the air. Giant steel girders tumbled like toothpicks. "We saw air conditioning ducts. We saw parts of buildings. And newspapers and debris, all in a dust ball coming at us!" said a police captain. The collapse generated a furious wind. One police officer was thrown from one side of the street to the other. "I was literally blown out of my shoes," she said. A monstrous, dirty cloud covered everything. "Picture taking ... flour and sticking it up your nose and in your mouth. That's what breathing was like," said another officer. "At the same time, I'm feeling debris hitting ... my legs, hitting my ankles, hearing it pile up above me." Fire Chief Ptieter and the other firefighters in the North Tower lobby heard a rumble. "I thought ... something was crashing through the lobby ... We ... huddled down at the base of the escalator. [The] whole area ... became totally black," Pfiefer said."We stayed there until the rumbling stopped. I never even suspected that the second tower collapsed." In the North Tower lobby, the doors of a stalled elevator opened. The collapse of the South Tower had cut the power to the elevator's door locks. From the car emerged Chris Young, the trapped passenger who'd been overlooked by rescue workers. Earlier he had boarded the elevator from a polished, modern lobby. Now he shuffled through clouds of dust, over rubble and debris. Alone. Pfiefer and the other firefighters had fled the lobby when the wreckage of the South Tower billowed through. Up to that moment, few people believed the buildings could be brought down. They had been designed to survive a jetliner collision. The towers had survived a massive terrorist bombing in 1993. And by the city's fire regulations, the floors were supposed to withstand two hours of fire. Now the chief's orders came quick: "Tower 1 to all units. Evacuate the building. Evacuate the building." A police helicopter hovered near the top of the wounded North Tower. "It looks like it's glowing red," the pilot said. Moments later, he added, "It appears to be buckling." Not all the firefighters in the tower heard the evacuation order. Some didn't believe it. Others wanted to evacuate as a unit and waited for fire company fellows to gather. Many of the emergency workers climbing the stairs were unaware that the South Tower had collapsed and failed to grasp the urgency of the evacuation order. Some wanted to catch their breath before continuing. "We'll come down in a few minutes," said one. When Fire Captain Jay Jonas learned the South Tower had crashed, he said, "It's time to get out of here." He led a small group of rescuers down a North Tower stairwell. Around the 12th floor, they met a groaning and crying Josephine Harris. Bad feet and a sixty-story descent had brought the office worker to a stop. "Bring her with us," Jonas said. They urged her along, ...</p><h2>Poisoned Prose (A Books by the Bay Mystery)</h2><p><i>When Olivia Limoges and other Oyster Bay patrons of the arts sponsor a retreat for famous storytellers, one of them is going to have a very unhappy ending...</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Olivia thought gathering some of the most renowned storytellers in one place would be a nice, simple way for herself and the Bayside Book Writers to appreciate their talents.

Add the parsley to the pan along with 1/2 cup of the pasta water. When the pasta is cooked, use a skimmer to lift it out of the water and directly into the pan, or drain it, reserving some of the water, and then add to the pan. Toss the pasta and let it simmer briefly in the sauce to finish cooking and absorb the flavors; add more pasta water if needed to keep the pasta loose and saucy. Taste the pasta for salt, and add more if needed.

To remove the wishbone at the top of the breast, use a small knife to scrape along the bone to expose it, then insert the knife and run it along the bone, separating it from the flesh. Use your fingers to loosen it further, grasp the tip of the wishbone, and pull it out. Tuck the wing tips back and under the neck.</p> <p>Tying the chicken plumps the breast up and brings the legs into position for even roasting. Cut a length of cotton string. With the chicken on its back, slip the string under the tail and bring the ends up over the legs to form a figure eight. Loop over the end of each leg and draw the string tight to bring the legs together. Draw the string back under the legs and wings on either side of the neck. Pull tight, wrap one end around the neck, and tie off the two ends. Salt the chicken evenly all around. Coarse salt has a good texture of large grains that makes it easy to calibrate how much salt you&#x2019;re putting on the chicken; sprinkle it from up high, so that it falls like snow. Season liberally with fresh-ground pepper.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 375�F, put all the vegetables and herbs together in the bottom of a large, heavy ovenproof pot, and season with salt and pepper. Set the chicken on top, dot with the butter, and roast uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes (or longer), depending on the size of the chicken. It is done when the leg joint is pierced with a knife and the juices run clear, not pink.</p> <p>Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before carving and serve family-style with all the caramelized vegetables and juices from the pot on a platter and the chicken pieces on top.</p> <br>ALICE WATERS's influence on American cooking is unrivaled.

What makes it different is that the prejudice also exists among those of us who are either within this group or rapidly approaching it. When I have mentioned the title of this book to a few people, most of them responded, 'Virtues? What could possibly be good about growing old?' The most obvious answer, of course, is to consider the alternative to aging. But there are plenty of other good answers--many based on our personal experiences and observations. "<br>--from THE VIRTUES OF AGING</p><p>Jimmy Carter (James Earl Carter, Jr.), thirty-ninth president of the United States, is the author of thirteen previous books. In 1982 he became University Distinguished Professor at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and founded The Carter Center, which addresses national and international issues of public policy and attempts to promote democracy, protect human rights, and prevent disease and other afflictions. In 1991, President Carter launched The Atlanta Project (TAP), a communitywide effort to attack the social problems associated with poverty. He also teaches Sunday school and is a deacon in the Maranatha Baptist Church of Plains. For recreation, he enjoys fly-fishing, woodworking, jogging, cycling, tennis, and skiing.Even before leaving the White House, Rosalynn and I received a notice from the American Association of Retired Persons that we were qualified for membership, but we considered ourselves too young to face the stigma of senior citizenship. However, once back in Plains the point was to be driven home most firmly and clearly. We live 120 miles south of Atlanta and habitually drive back and forth to The Carter Center and to Emory University, where I am a professor. One morning we left our house quite early and stopped to eat breakfast in Thomaston, Georgia, about halfway to Atlanta. There were four of us in the car, and we all ordered about the same thing. But when the waitress brought my bill, I noticed that it was less than the others. Perhaps seeking credit for being an honest customer, I called her back and began to tell her that she had made a mistake. An older farmer, dressed in overalls, was sitting at a nearby table and apparently overheard my conversation. He looked over at us and called out in a <br>loud voice, "Your bill ain't no mistake, Mr. President. Before eight o'clock they give free coffee to senior citizens."<br><br>A wave of laughter began at our table, and it still resonated through the restaurant as I paid my bill and hurried back to the car. For several weeks afterward, every time we approached Thomaston I knew that someone would say, "Why don't we stop here for breakfast? There's free coffee for some of us!"<br>In the years since returning home, Rosalynn and I have been through some severe tests and have struggled to find the best way to retain our self-confidence, evolve and interesting and challenging life, and build better relations with other people. As we've grown older the results have been surprisingly good.<br><br>The first time I fully realized how much our lives had changed was when I approached my seventieth birthday. In one of her hourlong special interviews, Barbara Walters covered all the aspects of my life, from the farm to submarienes, from business to the governor's mansion, service in the White House, and from president back home to Plains. Then she asked me a question that required some serious thought: "Mr. President, you have had a number of exciting and challenging careers. What have been your best years?" After a few moments I responded with absolute certainty: "<i>Now</i> is the best time of all." She was surprised, and asked, "Why?"<br><br>I fumbled with some thoughts about time for reflection, spending more time with my family, and a chance to correct some of my former errors. Afterward I realized how inadequate my glib, thirty-second answer had been, and I discussed with Rosalynn how profoundly different--and pleasant--was the reality of our senior years.<br><br>This book is my expanded attempt, based on our personal experiences, to answer that question--to describe, in effect, the virtues of aging.<br>We are not alone in our worry about both the physical aspects of aging and the prejudice that exists toward the elderly, which is similar to racism or sexism. What makes it different is that the prejudice also exists among those of us who are either within this group or rapidly approaching it. When I mentioned the title of this book to a few people, most of them responded, "Virtues? What could possibly be good about growing old?" The most obvious answer, of course, is to consider the <i>alternative</i> to aging. But there are plenty of other good answers--many based on our personal experiences and observations.<br><br>It is clear that in some ways Rosalynn and I are not typical, having been the First Family of a great nation, a special status that cuts both ways, with benefits <i>and</i> liabilities. But in almost every aspect of life, our challenges have been similar to those of tens of millions of families who face the later years with a mixture of problems and opportunities, doublts and anticipation, despair and hope. We've had to address a common question: How could we ensure that our retired years would be happy, and maybe even productive?</p><h2>DC Poster Portfolio: Stanley &#34;Artgerm&#34; Lau Vol. 2</h2><p><b>The follow-up to last year's popular poster collection, <i>DC Poster Portfolio: Stanley "Artgerm" Lau</i> showcases a wider selection of art by one of the most revered artists of our time.</b><br><br>DC Comics presents the artwork of illustrator Stanley "Artgerm" Lau, featuring 20 of his most stunning pieces starring some of the greatest superheroes and super-villains in comics history.

She was given a diary as a 13th birthday present and kept it from 12 June 1942 to 1 August 1944, during the period in which she and her family, together with others, hid from anti-jewish Nazi persecution in a small set of rooms above an Amsterdam warehouse. After Anne's arrest and deportation to Auschwitz and later to Bergen-Belsen in 1944, where she would eventually die in early 1945 from typhus, her diary was published by her father, Otto Frank, and became a worldwide bestseller.<p>&#x201c;A magisterial edition ... one of the virtues of <i>The</i> <i>Collected Works</i> is that it allows readers to track the evolution of the diary across its different incarnations ...<br><i>The Complete Works</i> thus gives a greatly enriched picture, and, as one reads its pages, one cannot help thinking of what Anne might have become.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bart van Es, Author of The Cut Out Girl, Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;An astonishing volume contextualising the significance of writing for Anne's spiritual and practical survival, and inscribing her words in time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New Statesman</i></p><p>&#x201c;Reveal[s] the German-born Frank as a complex human being, as much aware of her own flaws as of those around her&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Anne Frank: The Collected Works</i> includes the original diary as well as a version she edited and an amalgamation of the two, which is commonly taught in American schools.

But when Meg arrives in Florence, her father is nowhere to be found, leaving aspiring memoir-writer Sophia Borelli to introduce Meg to the rich beauty of the ancient city. Sofia claims to be one of the last surviving members of the Medici family and that a long-ago Medici princess, Nora Orsini, communicates with her from within the great masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Sophia, Meg, and Nora&#x2019;s stories intersect, their lives will be indelibly changed as they each answer the question: What if <i>renaissance </i>isn&#x2019;t just a word?

When she&#x2019;s not writing, Susan directs the Small Groups and Connection Ministries program at her San Diego church.The sun is setting on my last day in Florence. Tomorrow I will marry the man my uncle has chosen for me and Florence will be at my back, perhaps forever. My soon-to-be husband will have no reason to come here after we marry, and my uncle will not expect to see me again.

My grandmother is gone now, and her pictures and paintings have been scattered among my father&#x2019;s family members. But with my eyes shut, I can picture the rosy cap of the cathedral dome, the toast-colored stucco, the lizard-green Arno River as it lazes down its course. I can hear the odd cadence of European emergency sirens, the zipping of Vespas down asymmetrical streets, and the acoustic darts of a language I don&#x2019;t understand beyond simple endearments spoken by my nonna. I can smell the cappuccino&#x2014;because she told me hers smelled just like it&#x2014;the perfumed doorways of the fashion houses, the dense exhaust of too many cars. And I<br>can feel the cool, silken flesh of David&#x2019;s marbled feet if I were allowed to stretch out my hand and touch them.<br><br>Even now, so many years later, I can see the canvases on my grandmother&#x2019;s living room walls&#x2014;the litho of Botticelli&#x2019;s Primavera, the oil Nonna had done of a woman walking in the rain in a puddled piazza, the watercolor of rows of Italian cypresses and a young man on a bicycle. But the one of a young girl reaching toward a beckoning statue is the<br>only one I still dream about. My great-great-grandfather painted it when Nonna was young, before she and her parents immigrated to America. My grandmother was the girl in the painting, and the statue stood in the Florentine background. A palette of russets and burgundy and ocher filled the rest of the painting with depth and elegance, with a hint of blossoms to come.<br><br>Nonna used to tell me I was the girl in the painting, just as she had been when she was a little girl, an impossibly wondrous thought that I clung to until well after my eleventh birthday. Nonna, as the young girl, whose back was to my great-great-grandfather as he painted, wears a rosypink gown that glistens in the sunlight playing behind her. I used to imagine the statue was speaking to the girl and that&#x2019;s why her hand was extended&#x2014;as if she were inviting my grandmother to dance, to join her world of joy where anything unexpected was possible. I loved that painting and thought of it often, long after my parents divorced, long after my mother and I moved to San Diego and the visits to Nonna&#x2019;s dwindled. Nonna was going to take me to Florence when I graduated from high school to find the statue, but she died when I was twelve. I never saw that painting again after she died.<br><br>My father promised his mother, as she lay dying, that he would take me to Florence in her stead. I wasn&#x2019;t there when he promised her this. My mother and I were in San Diego when we got the call two days after she died that Nonna had had a massive heart attack. But Dad told me of the promise when my passionate grief over Nonna&#x2019;s death left him grappling for words to make me stop crying. Six years later, however, in the summer months following my high-school graduation, Dad had knee surgery. From then until now, the promised trip to Florence has been in a perpetual state of<br>postponement. From time to time he&#x2019;ll remark that we need to take that trip. He hasn&#x2019;t forgotten, but it&#x2019;s almost as if he&#x2019;s waiting for something to happen&#x2014;or change&#x2014;before he can make good on that promise.<br><br>Eighteen years after Nonna&#x2019;s death, I marvel that the mention of her birthplace still sounds like the name of a matronly soul, kind and sweet. Florence&#x2014;a woman with ample arms, a soft voice, and silver wisps in her hair. I&#x2019;ve been to London and Paris and to Aruba twice for publishing conferences. But the closest I&#x2019;ve come to visiting Florence are the phone calls I make to one of my authors who happens to live there.<br><br>A phone call to Lorenzo always makes me feel decidedly homesick.<br><br>I awoke to early-April coastal fog, frothy white like a bridal veil, and my first thought after remembering I&#x2019;d be Skyping with Lorenzo before nine, was that my ex-fianc� would marry that evening.<br><br>A blanket of mist coddled Bird Rock and the rest of the San Diego coast with a ghostlike embrace as I lay scrunched under the covers, wondering if Miles was feeling nervous or afraid. Was he thinking of me, even just a little? Would the unintended wound I gave him two years ago needle him as he got ready for the day? I hoped not. I didn&#x2019;t want to ruin his wedding day twice.<br><br>Coffee drunk, cheese omelet eaten, I gave scant thought as to what to wear to work. I wouldn&#x2019;t be rushing to Balboa Park for twilight nuptials. I chose a denim skirt, red-and-white-striped knit top, black flats. Chrome jewelry. Ponytail.<br><br>I was pouring a second cup of coffee into a travel mug when my cell phone rang. My mother&#x2019;s ringtone. I fished the phone out of my purse and answered with a cheerful &#x201c;Hello, Mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Meg. You don&#x2019;t have to pretend. It&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning to you too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You doing okay? Really?&#x201d; In the background I could hear her pushing buttons on her microwave.<br><br>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But today is not just any old Friday.&#x201d;<br><br>I replaced the carafe on the coffee maker and pressed the Off button. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. I&#x2019;m the one who broke up with Miles, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I remember. That doesn&#x2019;t mean you enjoyed having to do it. Or that you are enjoying this. You and Miles dated for two years. He&#x2019;s marrying someone else today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m happy for him.&#x201d; I screwed the top on my travel mug.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, well, I didn&#x2019;t call him to see how he&#x2019;s doing today. I called you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you&#x2019;re sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am. But thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>I heard the sound of the microwave whirring to life.<br><br>&#x201c;So, I was thinking if you&#x2019;re free tonight, we could meet up at the Melting Pot for dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother loves fondue restaurants. No one touches your food while it&#x2019;s cooking but you. No one touches it when it&#x2019;s done cooking but you. &#x201c;Why? Something up?&#x201d; I grabbed my car keys and then knelt to unlatch the kitty door for Alex, my borrowed cat. He brushed past me, meowing his thanks, and disappeared through it into the tiny backyard of the<br>cottage that I am caretaker for.<br><br>&#x201c;I just want to have dinner with you. I... There&#x2019;s...&#x201d; But she didn&#x2019;t continue.<br><br>I stood up. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. Can you come? Are you busy?&#x201d;<br><br>Since breaking off my engagement with Miles, I&#x2019;d given myself a year to heal&#x2014;wounding someone could be just as painful as being wounded by someone&#x2014;and then had spent the next twelve months slowly reentering the dating life. I&#x2019;d gone out on a few dates, but I hadn&#x2019;t met anyone I&#x2019;d wanted to rush into a relationship with. My mother had applauded my caution. Elaine Pomeroy always applauds caution. &#x201c;Better safe than sorry&#x201d; would be tattooed on my mother&#x2019;s forearm if she wasn&#x2019;t convinced tattoo artists don&#x2019;t properly clean their needles. She was all for me taking it<br>slow. Gabe, the graphic designer at the same publishing house where I work, is the closest I have come to dating anyone exclusively. We&#x2019;ve gone out a few times. The thing is, a dating relationship is always going somewhere. Even nowhere is a place. I didn&#x2019;t want to mess up Gabe&#x2019;s and my workplace friendship with a potential dating destination like nowhere. So I recently backed off&#x2014;a sublimely cautionary move my mother applauded&#x2014;and Gabe gallantly retreated. And I am not dating anyone else at the moment.<br><br>I had no plans for the evening of Miles&#x2019;s wedding. &#x201c;What time?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;How about seven thirty? Unless you want to do it earlier. I was thinking we&#x2019;d miss the worst of the evening traffic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven thirty is fine.&#x201d; I turned off the kitchen light and reached for my purse. &#x201c;See you then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. And your father is probably going to call you today.&#x201d;<br><br>My arm reaching for my purse paused midstretch. It wasn&#x2019;t odd that my father might call. Our amicable relationship includes occasional phone calls and the even more occasional visit. But it seemed odd to me that he&#x2019;d call today, out of the blue. Dad surely didn&#x2019;t know Miles was getting married that night. He couldn&#x2019;t have known. Unless my mother had called and told him. Nineteen years postdivorce my mother still calls my father to remind him of things she thinks he will forget, as if it still matters what he does and doesn&#x2019;t do.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you I&#x2019;m fine, Mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about Miles getting married. I&#x2019;m sure your father couldn&#x2019;t care less about that. I didn&#x2019;t call him. He called me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He lost your new cell phone number. All he has is your work number. So I gave it to him. I wasn&#x2019;t going to without asking you first, but he said he needed it to talk to you about something. And he didn&#x2019;t want to call you on your work phone.&#x201d;<br><br>As my mother talked, I began to conjure possibilities as to what my father would think important for me to know that he couldn&#x2019;t tell me at work. Maybe at long last he was setting a date for our trip to Florence?<br><br>&#x201c;If he is coming down today and wants to see you, do what you must,&#x201d; my mother continued. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t bring him to the Melting Pot.&#x201d; The tone in my mother&#x2019;s voice was a mix of apprehension and distaste.<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t bring him. And I doubt he&#x2019;s coming down. He could tell me that at work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ve always been a great many things he could have done and didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>Sunlight was peeking through the marine layer outside my kitchen window, reminding me that a full day at work awaited. I was due to talk with Lorenzo in less than fifteen minutes. It could take that long just to get from the cottage in Bird Rock to the office in downtown La Jolla, especially if all the good street parking was taken.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Mom. I&#x2019;ve got to run. I&#x2019;m Skyping with one of my authors, and I don&#x2019;t want to keep him waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Call me if you&#x2019;re going to be late tonight. And tell your father to give you a bit more notice next time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt he&#x2019;s coming down.

Saw it on the morning news. Don&#x2019;t rush out into it.

Plan and simple. Objectively it made no sense. I, who worked hard at being special, fell in love with a people who valued being ordinary." </em><p> So begins Sue Bender's story, the captivating and inspiring true story of a harried urban Californian moved by the beauty of a display of quilts to seek out and live with the Amish. Discovering lives shaped by unfamiliar yet comforting ideas about time, work, and community, Bender is gently coaxed to consider, "Is there another way to lead a good life?" </p><p> Her journey begins in a New York men's clothing store. There she is spellbound by the vibrant colors and stunning geometric simplicity of the Amish quilts "spoke directly to me," writes Bender. Somehow, "they went straight to my heart." </p><p> Heeding a persistent inner voice, Bender searches for Amish families willing to allow her to visit and share in there daily lives. <em>Plain and Simple</em> vividly recounts sojourns with two Amish families, visits during which Bender enters a world without television, telephone, electric light, or refrigerators; a world where clutter and hurry are replaced with inner quiet and calm ritual; a world where a sunny kitchen "glows" and "no distinction was made between the sacred and the everyday." </p><p> In nine interrelated chapters--as simple and elegant as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt--Bender shares the quiet power she found reflected in lives of joyful simplicity, humanity, and clarity. The fast-paced, opinionated, often frazzled Bender returns home and reworks her "crazy-quilt" life, integrating the soul-soothing qualities she has observed in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns in the Amish, and celebrating the patterns formed by the distinctive "patches" of her own life. </p><p> Charmingly illustrated and refreshingly spare, <em>Plain and Simple</em> speaks to the seeker in each of us.</p></p><p><br>Sue Bender is the author of <em>Plain and Simple: A Woman's Journey to the Amish</em> (HarperSanFrancisco). The book was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. A fascination with Amish quilts led Sue to live with the Amish in their seemingly timeless world, a landscape of immense inner quiet. This privilege, rarely bestowed upon outsiders, taught her about simplicity and commitment and the contentment that comes from accepting who you are. In this inspiring book, Bender shares the lessons she learned while in the presence of the Amish people.<p>In <em>Everyday Sacred: A Woman's Journey Home</em> (HarperSanFrancisco: now in its sixth printing), Bender speaks to our longing to make each day truly count. She chronicles her struggle to bring the joyful wisdom and simplicity she experienced in her sojourn with the Amish back to her hectic, too-much-to-do days at home. Bender discovers for herself, and in the process shows us, that small miracles can be found everywhere'in our homes, in our daily activities and, hardest to see, in ourselves.</p><p>Profiles and interviews with Ms. Bender, as well as book excerpts have been published in countless national publications including <em>Reader's Digest</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Ladies' Home Journal, The Chicago Tribune, The Utne Reader</em>, and <em>W Magazine</em>. She has also appeared as a guest on dozens of radio and television shows.</p><p>Born in New York City, Sue Bender received her BA from Simmons College and her MA from the Harvard University School of Education. She taught high school in New York and English at the Berlitz School in Switzerland. She later earned a Masters in Social Work from the University of California at Berkeley. During her active years as a family therapist, Bender was founder and Director of CHOICE: The Institute of the Middle Years. In addition to being an author and former therapist, Sue Bender is a ceramic artist and much sought after lecturer nationwide. She lives in Berkeley, California with her husband Richard, and is the mother of two grown sons.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>How It Began</b></p><p>Can an object go straight to your heart ? </p><p>Twenty years ago I walked into Latham's Men's Store in Sag Harbor, New York, and saw old quilts used as a background for men's tweeds. I had never seen quilts like that. Odd color combinations. Deep saturated solid colors: purple, mauve, green, brown, magenta, electric blue, red. Simple geometric forms: squares, diamonds, rectangles. A patina of use emanated from them. They spoke directly to me. They knew something. They went straight to my heart. </p><p>That was the beginning. Innocent enough. </p><p>"Who made these quilts?" I demanded. </p><p>"The Amish." </p><p>I went back to Latham's every day that summer, as if in a trance, not noticing it at first, just something I did in the midst of all the other things I was doing. Visiting the quilts became a practice, something like a spiritual practice, the one constant in days that were otherwise filled with the activities of summer. </p><p>I stared at the quilts. They seemed so silent: a "silence like thunder." It was 1967, and I was thirty-three years old. </p><p>I had seen lots of old quilts before, made by non-Amish women. They drew on an unlimited palette: plaid, polka dots, calico, corduroy, velvet. Their patterns were endless: Geese in Flight, Log Cabin, Bear Paw, Fans, Pinwheel, School House, Broken Dishes, Old Maid's Puzzle, Indian Hatchet, Crown of Thorns, and many more. </p><p>The Amish used the same few patterns over and over--no need to change the pattern, no need to make an individual statement. </p><p>The basic forms were tempered by tiny, intricate black quilting stitches. The patterns-tulips, feathers, wreaths, pineapples, and stars--softened and complemented the hard lines, and the contrast of simple pattern and complex stitchery gave the flat, austere surface an added dimension. I wondered if quilting was an acceptable way for a woman to express her passion? </p><p>I learned that the Amish used their old clothing to make the haunting colors in the quilts. Nothing was wasted; out of the scrap pile came those wondrous saturated colors. Like most deeply religious farm people, the Amish wore dark, solid-colored clothing, made from homespun material. But underneath, hidden from view, were brightly colored petticoats, blouses, and shirts. </p><p>Colors of such depth and warmth were combined in ways I had never seen before. At first the colors looked somber, but then looking closely at a large field of brown--I discovered that it was really made up of small patches of many different shades and textures of color. Greys and shiny dark and dull light brown, dancing side by side, made the flat surface come alive. Lush greens lay beside vivid reds. An electric blue appeared as if from nowhere on the border. </p><p>The relationship of the individual parts to the whole, the proportion, the way the inner and outer borders reacted with each other was a balancing act between tension and harmony. </p><p>The quilts spoke to such a deep place inside me that I felt them reaching out, trying to tell me something, but my mind was thoroughly confused. How could pared-down and daring go together? How could a quilt be calm and intense at the same time? Can an object do that? Can an object know something?</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>How opposite my life was from an Amish quilt. </p><p>My life was like a CRAZY QUILT, a pattern I hated. Hundreds of scattered, unrelated, stimulating fragments, each going off in its own direction, creating a lot of frantic energy. There was no overall structure to hold the pieces together. The Crazy Quilt was a perfect metaphor for my life. </p><p>A tug-of-war was raging inside me. </p><p>In contrast to the muted colors of the Amish, I saw myself in extremes: a black-and-white person who made black-and-white ceramics and organized her life around a series of black-and-white judgments. </p><p>I divided my world into two lists. All the "creative" things--the things I valued, being an artist, thinking of myself as undisciplined and imaginative--were on one side, and the boring, everyday things--those deadly, ordinary chores that everyone has to do, the things I thought distracted me from living an artistic life--were on the other side. </p><p>I was an ex-New Yorker living most of the time in Berkeley, California; a wife and mother of two sons; an artist and a therapist with two graduate degrees, one from Harvard, one from Berkeley. That was my resume. </p><p>I valued accomplishments. </p><p>I valued being special. </p><p>I valued results. </p><p>The driven part didn't question or examine these values. It took them as real, and believed it was following the carrot "success" wholeheartedly. Didn't everyone believe in success? I never asked, "Success at what cost?" </p><p>A part of me is quiet. It knows about simplicity, about commitment, and the joy of doing what I do well. That part is the artist, the child--it is receptive and has infinite courage. But time and my busyness drowned the quiet voice. </p><p>In the world in which I grew up, more choices meant a better life.</p><p>It was true for both my parents and my grandparents. I was brought up to believe that the more choices I had, the better. </p><p>Never having enough time, I wanted it all, a glutton for new experience. Excited, attracted, distracted, tempted in all directions, I thought I was lucky to have so many choices and I naively believed I could live them all. </p><p>A tyranny of lists engulfed me. The lists created the illusion that my life was full. </p><p>I would wake at five A.M. eager to begin. The first thing I did was to compose my <i>Things to Do</i> list. This gave me great pleasure, even though the list was nothing more than a superimposed heap of choices, representing all the things I enjoyed doing and all the things I had to do, crowding and bumping against each other. Any organized person would have said "This is ridiculous. It's unrealistic. No one could accomplish so many things in one day."</p></p><h2>Buddhist Wisdom: The Diamond Sutra and The Heart Sutra</h2><p>A landmark publication which offers Western readers a unique combination of what Buddhists worldwide consider the holiest of holy texts <i>The Diamond Sutra</i> and <i>The Heart Sutra</i>, two sutras, or scriptures, ascribed to the early centuries of the first millennium.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Diamond Sutra</i>, or the <i>Perfection of Wisdom,</i> which cuts like a thunderbolt, is one of the cornerstone texts of Mahayana Buddhism and provides a summary of the core concepts of the Buddha. <i>The Heart Sutra</i>, perhaps the most important of all Buddhist texts, sets out to formulate the very heart, or essence of perfect wisdom and is studied with special reverence in Zen monasteries and the Tibetan Buddhist lamaseries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Edward Conze, who was until his death in 1979 a powerful force for introducing Buddhism and its sacred texts to the West, has provided these translated key texts with an extensive commentary for the easiest possible appreciation phrase by phrase.&nbsp; For this new edition, Judith Simmer-Brown, a well-known American scholar of Buddhism, has contributed a lively, context-setting introduction.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the annals of spirituality, certain books stand out both for their historical importance and for their continued relevance.

Since many of us were taught in public schools, we often have a pretty good idea of what we don't want our children to learn. But what exactly should we give them instead?<p></p><p>The authors of <i>Repairing the Ruins</i>, a group of experienced teachers and schools administrators, faced this same question when they first embarked on the journey of education. They found a tried and true answer in classical Christian education. Here they explain what makes classical Christian education different from modern methods and why it offers a distinctly Christian alternative. Building upon this foundation, the authors provide parents with the ""Whys and Hows"" of the Trivium, tips on planning curriculum, wisdom in designing education to serve the heart as well as the mind, and advice on starting up schools.</p><p></p><p>For all who have ever wondered where to begin with their children's education, <i>Repairing the Ruins</i> comes alongside with words of comfort and direction. This collection is edited by Douglas Wilson, and includes essays from Tom Garfield, Chris Schlect, Douglas Jones, and Tom Spencer, as well as an introduction by Marlin Detweiler."</p></p><p><i>Repairing the Ruins</i> offers a complete classical educators conference in a single book. The advice and inspiration gleaned from each essay encourages teachers and parents to confidently lead their students in the great classical conversations of Christendom.

A few hours later, one of those pretty ladies ends up dead -- with not a hair out of place.

It is spring 1986 in the city of Santiago, and Augusto Pinochet is losing his grip on power. In one of the city&#39;s many poor neighborhoods works the Queen of the Corner, a hopeless and lonely romantic who embroiders linens for the wealthy and listens to boleros to drown out the gunshots and rioting in the streets. Along comes Carlos, a young, handsome man who befriends the aging homosexual and uses his house to store mysterious boxes and hold clandestine meetings. My Tender Matador is an extraordinary novel of revolution and forbidden love, and a stirring portrait of Chile at an historical crossroads. By turns funny and profoundly moving, Pedro Lemebel&#39;s lyrical prose offers an intimate window into the mind of Pinochet himself as the world of Carlos and the Queen prepares to collide with the dictator&#39;s own in a fantastic and unexpected way.</p><p>Chile and its capital, Santiago, were in turmoil in 1986. The Pinochet regime was under fire from within, and the country was rife with activists, strikes, and riots. Lemebel crafts a wonderful snapshot of this period of Chile's history--pairing fictional characters against real ones. The Queen of the Corner is a cross-dressing, effeminate gay man who embroiders for a living and harbors an unrequited love for Carlos, a handsome young revolutionary from the university. At first, Carlos only wishes to store mysterious boxes at the Queen's house. Then late-night "study meetings" with his compatriots from the university become more and more frequent. Deftly woven into the stories of the fictional characters are the activities of the paranoid Pinochet himself and his fashion-obsessed wife. The Queen eventually comes to realize that his house is serving as a front for the revolutionaries, and a touching tale of love and danger emerges. Lemebel's tender story of a time of great unrest provides an extremely engaging read and a portrait of love and loss under a cruel dictator. <i>Michael Spinella</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Within a decade, she was a white Indian with a chin tattoo, caught between cultures. <i>The Blue Tattoo</i> tells the harrowing story of this forgotten heroine of frontier America. Orphaned when her family was brutally killed by Yavapai Indians, Oatman lived as a slave to her captors for a year before being traded to the Mohave, who tattooed her face and raised her as their own. She was fully assimilated and perfectly happy when, at nineteen, she was ransomed back to white society. She became an instant celebrity, but the price of fame was high and the pain of her ruptured childhood lasted a lifetime.<br>Based on historical records, including letters and diaries of Oatman&#x2019;s friends and relatives, <i>The Blue Tattoo</i> is the first book to examine her life from her childhood in Illinois&#x2014;including the massacre, her captivity, and her return to white society&#x2014;to her later years as a wealthy banker&#x2019;s wife in Texas.<br>Oatman&#x2019;s story has since become legend, inspiring artworks, fiction, film, radio plays, and even an episode of <i>Death Valley Days</i> starring Ronald Reagan. Its themes, from the perils of religious utopianism to the permeable border between civilization and savagery, are deeply rooted in the American psyche. Oatman&#x2019;s blue tattoo was a cultural symbol that evoked both the imprint of her Mohave past and the lingering scars of westward expansion. It also served as a reminder of her deepest secret, fully explored here for the first time: she never wanted to go home.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Margot Mifflin is an author and journalist who writes about women, art, and contemporary culture.

She had expected to find sanctuary in the cozy Cape house that had once been her grandmother's and now was hers, but the icy sleet beating against the windows only increased the terror she was experiencing. Then, when a power failure plunged the house into darkness, she lay awake, sure that every sound was caused by an intruder.</p><p>After fifteen years, she was certain that she had accidentally stumbled upon the knowledge of who had strangled her roommate, Jamie, when they were both struggling young actresses. And he knows that I know, she thought -- I could see it in his eyes.</p><p>On Friday night, he had come with a group to the closing night of <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> at the Omega Playhouse. She had played Blanche DuBois, the most demanding and satisfying role of her career to date. Her reviews had been wonderful, but the role had taken its emotional toll on her. That was why, after the performance, when someone knocked on the door of her dressing room, she had been tempted not to answer. But she had, and they all crowded in to congratulate her, and out of nowhere she recognized him. In his late forties now, his face had filled out, but he was undoubtedly the person whose picture was missing from Jamie's wallet after her body was found. Jamie had been so secretive about him, only referring to him as Jess, "my pet name for him," as she put it.</p><p>I was so shocked that when we were introduced, I called him "Jess," Natalie thought. Everyone was talking so much that I am sure no one else noticed. But <i>he</i> heard me say his name.</p><p>Who do I tell? Who would <i>believe</i> me? My word against his? My memory of a small picture that Jamie had hidden in her wallet? I only found it because I had lent her my Visa card and I needed it back. She was in the shower and called to me to get it out of her wallet. That was when I saw the picture, tucked in one of the compartments, behind a couple of business cards.</p><p>All Jamie ever told me about him was that he'd tried his hand at acting and wasn't good enough, and that he was in the middle of a divorce. I tried to tell her that was the oldest story in the world, Natalie thought, but she wouldn't listen. She and Jamie had been sharing an apartment on the West Side until that terrible morning when Jamie was strangled while jogging early in Central Park. Her wallet was on the ground, her money and watch were missing. And so wasthe picture of "Jess." I told the cops that, she thought, but they didn't take it seriously. There had been a number of early-morning muggings in the park and they were sure Jamie just happened to be one of the victims, the only fatal victim, as it turned out.</p><p>It had been pouring through Rhode Island and Connecticut, but as Natalie drove down the Palisades Parkway the rain steadily lessened. As she drove farther down, she could see that the roads were already drying.</p><p>Would she feel safe at home? She wasn't sure. Twenty years ago, after being widowed, her mother, born and raised in Manhattan, had been happy to sell the house and buy a small apartment near Lincoln Center. Last year, when Natalie and Gregg separated, she heard that the modest house in northern New Jersey where she'd been raised was for sale again.</p><p>"Natalie," her mother warned, "you're making a terrible mistake. I think you're crazy not to try to make a go of your marriage. Running back home is never the answer for anyone. You can't recreate the past."</p><p>Natalie knew it was impossible to make her mother understand that the kind of wife Gregg wanted and needed was not the person she could ever be for him. "I was unfair to Gregg when I married him," she said. "He needed a wife who would be a real mother to Katie. I can't be. Last year I was away a total of six months in all. It just isn't working. I honestly think that when I move out of Manhattan, he'll understand that the marriage is really over."</p><p>"You're still in love with him," her mother insisted. "And he is with you."</p><p>"That doesn't mean we're good for each other."</p><p>I'm right about that, Natalie thought, as she swallowed the lump in her throat that was always there when she allowed herself to think about Gregg. She wished she could talk to him about what had happened Friday evening. What would she say? "Gregg, what do I do about having the certain knowledge that I know who killed my friend Jamie, without a shred of proof to back me up?" But she couldn't ask him. There was too much of a chance that she'd be unable to resist his begging her to try again. Even though she'd lied and told him she was interested in someone else, it hadn't stopped Gregg's phone calls.</p><p>As she turned off the parkway onto Walnut Street, Natalie realized she was longing for a cup of coffee. She had driven straight through and it was quarter of eight. By this time, on a normal day, she would already have had at least two cups.</p><p>Most of the houses on Walnut Street in Closter had been torn down to make way for new luxury homes. It was her joke that now she had seven-foot hedges on either side of her house, giving her complete privacy from either neighbor. Years ago, the Keenes had been on one side and the Foleys on the other. Today, she hardly knew who her neighbors were.</p><p>The sense of something hostile hit her as she turned in to her driveway and pushed the clicker to open the garage door. As the door began to rise, she shook her head. Gregg had been right when he said that she became every character she played. Even before the stress of meeting Jess, her nerves had been unraveling, like those of Blanche DuBois.</p><p>She drove into the garage, stopped, but for some reason did not immediately push the clicker to close the garage door behind her.

She is a writer and journalist, and has contributed to <i>Gourmet</i>, <i>Saveur</i>, and <i>Gastronomica</i>, as well as <i>Marie Claire</i> and <i>Elle</i>. Her popular cooking classes in Cambridge, Massachusetts, focus on the flavors and cooking styles of the Mediterranean and on creating innovative and delicious meals with whole grains.<b>Introduction: The Glamour of Whole Grains</b><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Whole grains have cast a spell on me&#x2014;from the first sweetened wheat berries I chewed on during my grandfather&#x2019;s funeral to the comforting corn polenta my Greek mother makes to this day. I crave the tender chewiness of brown rice, the soft, translucent pearls of quinoa, and the warming lightness of millet. I love the subtle sweetness of whole oats, the slight sourness of rye, and the pleasing nuttiness of wheat berries. But I don&#x2019;t eat whole grains because they are healthy, or wholesome, or to reap their nutritional benefits. To me, whole grains carry luxurious qualities: lively textures, vivid colors, and rich flavors.<br>&nbsp;<br>My passion is rooted in my upbringing. I was raised by a Greek mom, a fervent home cook, and a gluttonous food-loving father from Germany. I spent parts of my childhood in Greece, where my grandmother and my aunt would rise at 4:oo A.M. on holidays to prepare food for the extended family, from elaborately stuffed grape leaves with currants and pine nuts to oven-roasted kid lamb and bulgur pilaf. And I spent my formative years in Germany, where whole grains are part of the culinary fabric to this day, most famously in the country&#x2019;s rustic loaves of dark bread. <br>&nbsp;<br>Our family table reflected these two contrasting cultures: my mom&#x2019;s tomato omelet with feta cheese was served with huge slices of my dad&#x2019;s favorite whole grain bread, cut from a traditional loaf almost the size of a bicycle tire. One week we indulged on German pork roast with homemade gravy, the next we spooned into tangy Greek stifadho, a wine-infused beef stew. My dad couldn&#x2019;t imagine life without liverwurst; my mom suffered when she couldn&#x2019;t find oranges or lemons. <br>&nbsp;<br>This heritage is at the heart of this book. In it, I combine my mom&#x2019;s Mediterranean cuisine&#x2014;its simplicity, its mesmerizing aromas, and its use of fresh ingredients&#x2014;with the centuries-old traditions of preparing whole grain foods in northern Europe. In a nutshell, this whole grain cookbook brings you the bounty of the Mediterranean in tandem with the vast universe of ancient whole grains. It will take you on a journey from Greece to Turkey, from the south of France to Italy, and to Lebanon, adding tempting and delicious meals to your table with innovative flavors and new textures, some tender and some toothsome. <br>&nbsp;<br>The recipes in this book will show you how to transform these ancient staples into fresh modern meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even dessert&#x2014;while adding health benefits all along. Whole grains were, after all, the building blocks of our diet through the millennia. But do not expect me to lecture about them, or remind you to eat them regularly. I&#x2019;d much rather have you try many of them and discover their remarkable textures and stunning variety&#x2014;because eating is about pleasure first, and dieting last. I believe food has to be mouthwatering and seductive to stay in our meal plan for good. This is why I use rich natural ingredients like butter, cream and bacon, though in moderation. To me, whole grains are the ultimate comfort food. Chewy, sensual, and immensely satisfying, they are homey and nourishing in an old-fashioned way. And economical to boot. <br>&nbsp;<br>In this book you will learn how to utilize quick-cooking grains like polenta, buckwheat, couscous, and millet as well as how to prepare &#x201c;slower&#x201d; whole grain berries in advance for a busy workweek. Whether you are a novice in the kitchen or an experienced home cook, you will find many short cuts and practical advice. <br>&nbsp;<br>This book is not a whole grain bible, or the definitive guide to the grains of this planet. It is, rather, a personal selection of the whole grains I like to eat, inspired by the flavors and ingredients on which I was raised. And while most of these recipes draw from the rich food culture of the Mediterranean, they are typically not traditional dishes. Just like humans, traditions in food are always in flux. Today, in posh bakeries in Thessaloniki in northern Greece where my extended family lives, you find traditional olive oil cakes right next to, yes, American muffins. But these muffins are flavored with distinct local flavors and ingredients for their Greek customers, as are the anise-flavored muffins in this book, with dates and dried apricots and pistachios. Or indulge in saffron-scented waffles, topped with a creamy, rich yogurt topping with oranges&#x2014;these are the flavors of my childhood, yet waffles, to my knowledge, have not yet arrived in the Mediterranean. Or have they? <br>&nbsp;<br>Other recipes will transport you to the Mediterranean in an instant: enrich dinner with a wine-infused mussel stew with tomatoes and farro, an artichoke-rosemary tart with polenta crust, or an easy pasta with ground lamb and minted yogurt. Or feast on a stunning Moroccan-inspired salad with Kamut berries, carrots, cinnamon, and pomegranate seeds. For dessert, choose from an intensely fruity olive oil cake, bursting with figs plumped in orange-scented liqueur, or a purple rice pudding with rose water&#x2013;infused dates. <br>&nbsp;<br>While almost all of the recipes are Mediterranean-inspired, I couldn&#x2019;t hide my German roots. They bring you a luxurious chocolate-hazelnut muesli with dark chocolate and a crusty aromatic loaf of whole grain bread, flavored with coriander and fennel. And let&#x2019;s not forget an olive bread with bacon and thyme. Bacon, as an ingredient, has re-entered my cooking only in recent years. After all, my last name, Speck, means &#x201c;bacon&#x201d; in German. Having faced relentless teasing as a kid in school, I shunned this ancient ingredient for way too long&#x2014;this bread brought it back, with a Mediterranean twist. <br>&nbsp;<br>I believe the glamorous qualities of whole grains are vastly underrated. With this book, I would like to invite you to explore their star power. I hope you will learn more about matching and pairing their unique flavors and splendid textures, adding culinary highlights to your everyday life. Give these ancient staples a try&#x2014;never have they been so ready for our modern tables. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>Musings on Health, Dieting, and Good Eating </b><br>&nbsp;<br>Almost every conversation about my passion for whole grains evokes this well-meaning remark: &#x201c;Your diet must be very healthy.&#x201d; This comment always leaves me speechless, because health is the last thing on my mind when I eat. Of course, we all want to eat and live in a healthy way. But the reality is that good intentions rarely last, even a day. <br>&nbsp;<br>Today, I don&#x2019;t try anymore. I have stopped dieting for good. Like most women and many men, I have dieted many times, and from a young age. But I never had much stamina. Dieting exhausted me&#x2014;not because I was weakened by a lack of food (I was a reasonable dieter), but simply because I ended up fantasizing about food all the time. Especially about all the food I was not allowed to eat. I soon found myself thinking about chocolate truffles every ten seconds, about a piece of German cream torte one minute, and about lamb chops or deep-fried calamari the next. This soon became unbearable, and distracting. So I did what every reasonable person would do: I drifted toward my dreams and broke my diet, again and again&#x2014;until whole grains came along. <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m not telling you that whole grains will make you lose twenty pounds in one month. But in my case, they succeeded in doing what no diet had done before. They brought me, a fast-food lover at the time, back into the kitchen. Whole grains and their tantalizing textures and fantastic flavors made me so curious about food that I started to cook. Soon I was on the best diet I have ever been on. And I stayed on it, for good. Most important, it included all food&#x2014;cream, butter, bacon, and cookies&#x2014;can you see where I&#x2019;m going? I soon started to familiarize myself with unknown fruits and vegetables, and later with fish and meats of all kinds. Cooking made me appreciate food. It made me slow down and enjoy. Today we call this &#x201c;mindful eating.&#x201d; I believe this happens naturally&#x2014;when you cook. <br>&nbsp;<br>I admit I was very lucky. Unlike many of us today, I was never introduced to whole grains as a health food. No one lectured me to add them to my diet, or reprimanded me to eat them because they are &#x201c;oh so good for you.&#x201d; When I was growing up in Greece and Germany, some whole grains were still part of everyday life. In Greece, as a kid, I excitedly chewed on wheat berries, barley rusk, and bulgur. In Germany I spooned into warm oatmeal and indulged on whole grain breads, from crusty chewy wheat loaves to deliciously dense rye breads. But that changed when I moved away from home. Frozen pizza and ready-made chocolate pudding with whipped cream became my main food groups, accompanied by coffee, cigarettes, and wine&#x2014;I was a journalist at a news agency, after all.<br>&nbsp;<br>That all changed when a German friend of mine brought the whole grains of my childhood back to my table. Without uttering a line about health, she just put plate after plate of lip-smacking, tasty whole grain dishes in front of me&#x2014;soups, salads, pies, and tarts, all with a distinct chew and impressive yet understated flavor. Hildegard, a single mom and my neighbor at the time, served whole grains with the fervor of a chef. She didn&#x2019;t skimp on cream or butter. Her meals were beautifully simple, and while German, they were Mediterranean in spirit. She successfully paired the unique flavor of each grain with fish or cheese, fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, marrying them to perfection. She was always hunting for the best ingredients. Her fruit and vegetables were fresh from the farmers&#x2019; market, her cream and butter organic when possible. Today we would call someone like her a locavore. I think all she wanted was to eat well. To me, this passion was contagious. She opened up a gustatory universe. And made me curious about whole grains&#x2014;so much so that it changed my life. <br>&nbsp;<br>What are whole grains, anyway? They are exactly what the name implies, the whole kernels or seeds of a grain with only the inedible outer husk removed, while the nutritious bran and germ are retained. The germ contains natural oils that can go rancid when exposed to air. In refined all-purpose flour, rice, or wheat, the bran and germ are removed for longer shelf life. Unfortunately, much of the nutrients are thrown out as well&#x2014;you are left with the starchy endosperm, the center of the grain, containing largely &#x201c;empty calories.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Whole grains, on the other hand, contain beneficial minerals such as iron and magnesium, B vitamins, vitamin E, antioxidants, and fiber. On average, Americans eat only 15 grams of fiber per day, about half of what is recommended. While fiber is not digested, it helps your digestion and it keeps you feeling full longer. This is great news for anyone trying to shed those extra pounds. No magic diet pill needed. Last but not least, it never hurts to know a few hard-nosed facts about adding more whole grains to your diet:<br>&nbsp;<br>� Repeated studies have shown that a diet rich in whole grains significantly reduces the risk of major chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke.<br>� Eating three servings of whole grains per day can reduce the risk of certain cancers.<br>� People who eat whole grains regularly have a lower risk of obesity. They also have lower cholesterol levels.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is all I want to say about the health benefits of whole grains. Much has been written on the topic, and one quick search on the Internet will bring you up to date. But mainly I don&#x2019;t want to tout the health benefits of whole grains because I don&#x2019;t believe this will actually make us eat them. After all, experts have been trumpeting these messages for years&#x2014;yet so many of us still don&#x2019;t know what most whole grains look like. <br>&nbsp;<br>So why don&#x2019;t we eat more whole grains? For one, I believe, it&#x2019;s because we don&#x2019;t know how to cook them. Fair enough. But I believe the real reason is that when it comes to whole grains, we are constantly reminded that we have to eat them because they are good for us. And that is also how they are still often served. Go to a bakery and you will find an assortment of beautiful breads with nuts and seeds, olives and sun-dried tomatoes, and then the one, oh-so-plain, whole wheat loaf. Or try a whole grain salad at a lunch buffet. Healthy it might be, with all the right ingredients, with lowfat this and no-fat that. I have chewed through many of those well-intentioned bowls. The thought makes me cringe. Because everyone else on the table is having a really good meal. Thank you very much. <br>&nbsp;<br>I believe the only way to eat well for good is to eat all good food, within reason. Renowned journalist Michael Pollan puts it this way: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn&#x2019;t recognize as food.&#x201d; Cookbook author and food writer Mark Bittman from the New York Times calls it a &#x201c;moderate diet of wholesome foods.&#x201d; I believe whole grains have to be a significant part of our everyday meals to make us eat and live better, and perhaps even to lose a few pounds along the way. But first and foremost, they have to be deliriously delicious. Why else would we try them? <br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Truffle Theory</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My eating philosophy can be summed up in what I call the truffle theory. It is based on my own experience, and it derives from one of my deluxe culinary pleasures: eating a homemade chocolate truffle. <br>&nbsp;<br>When I buy a box of truffles, I often devour the whole box in, say, one day. Not so if I make my own. When one of my homemade dark chocolate truffles with cream, butter, and a fleeting hint of Grand Marnier starts to melt on my tongue, I go quiet fast. Not only is its sensational freshness positively overwhelming; I am also reminded of its creation. I remember the effort that went into making these unevenly shaped pieces of bliss. The wait for the silky ganache to cool. The brisk rolling between my palms so as not to melt the chocolate. And the good ingredients I bought to make them in the first place. So to my own surprise, one or two truffles will be all I eat. I don&#x2019;t have to tell myself to stop. It just happens because each truffle is simply so good. <br>&nbsp;<br>I admit this is an indulgent start to an eating philosophy in a whole grain cookbook, yet it best encompasses my four principles of eating well: <br>&nbsp;<br>� Cook as often you can. <br>� Eat everything, with pleasure and not in a rush. <br>� Buy whole ingredients, close to home.&nbsp; <br>� Strive for imperfection; no need to be a four-star chef.<br>&nbsp;<br>This, in essence, also sums up the pleasures of the Mediterranean table and how I was raised. From Greece, to Turkey and Tunisia, from Italy to Israel, from Spain to France&#x2014;eating across the Mediterranean is a soulful combination of cooking from scratch and preparing mouthwatering meals with whatever is on hand. Tables can be bursting with plates as if there is no tomorrow, or just have a few luscious appetizers. Ingredients are farm-fresh and simple. Most important, everyone comes together, takes their time to eat, and relishes the food.</p><h2>The Adventures of Robin Hood: Illustrated by Walter Crane (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>The story of the English folk hero and medieval outlaw Robin Hood who as legend would have it lived in the days of Richard the Lionheart and Prince John and, with his band of merry men, fought injustice and tyranny. This retelling of the stories, first published in 1956, has become an acknowledged classic: a literary mosaic in which Roger Lancelyn Green has brought together material from the old ballads, romances and plays, as well as retellings of Noyes, Tennyson, Peacock and Scott. &#x201c;For Robin Hood&#x2019;s is a story that can never die,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;nor cease to fire the imagination.

In brilliant dialogue with Adorno, Levinas, Foucault, and other thinkers, she eloquently argues the limits, possibilities, and dangers of contemporary ethical thought.</p><p>Butler offers a critique of the moral self, arguing that the transparent, rational, and continuous ethical subject is an impossible construct that seeks to deny the specificity of what it is to be human. We can know ourselves only incompletely, and only in relation to a broader social world that has always preceded us and already shaped us in ways we cannot grasp. If inevitably we are partially opaque to ourselves, how can giving an account of ourselves define the ethical act? And doesn&#x2019;t an ethical system that holds us impossibly accountable for full self-knowledge and self-consistency inflict a kind of psychic violence, leading to a culture of self-beratement and cruelty? How does the turn to social theory offer us a chance to understand the specifically social character of our own unknowingness about ourselves?</p><p>In this invaluable book, by recasting ethics as a project in which being ethical means becoming critical of norms under which we are asked to act, but which we can never fully choose, Butler illuminates what it means for us as &#x201c;fallible creatures&#x201d; to create and share an ethics of vulnerability, humility, and ethical responsiveness.</p></p><p><p>Judith Butler is Maxine Elliot Professor of Comparative Literature and Critical Theory at the University of California at Berkeley. She is the author of The Psychic Life of Power (1997), Antigone&#x2019;s Claim (2000), Giving an<br>Account of Oneself (2005), Parting Ways: Jewishness and the Critique of Zionism<br>(2012), and Senses of the Subject (2015). She works in the fields of feminist and queer theory, European philosophy, social theory, and ethics.</p>In a time when moral certitude is used to justify the worst violence, Butler's nuanced reworking of what it means to be ethically responsible to ourselves and to others is welcome indeed. (&#x2015;Drucilla Cornell <i>Rutgers University</i>)<br><br>A brave book by a courageous thinker. (&#x2015;Hayden White <i>University of California and Stanford University</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;In stunningly original interpretations of Adorno and Levinas, . . .Judith Butler compellingly demonstrates that questions of ethics<br>cannot avoid addressing the moral self&#x2019;s complicity with violence.<br>By laying out the premises of a creative rereading, this study<br>proves that the discussion of these two authors and their future<br>legacy has, in a sense, barely begun. Butler writes in a truly<br>Spinozistic spirit, mobilizing the greatest forces and joys of<br>philosophical intelligence to counteract and redirect the cruelest<br>and most destructive of human passions. Brilliantly argued and<br>beautifully written, Giving an Account of Oneself is destined<br>to become a classic, a must read for philosophers and students of<br>present-day culture and politics alike.&#x201d;</p> (&#x2015;Hent de Vries <i>The Johns Hopkins University</i>)<br><br>A powerful exploration of the intersection of identity and responsibility, Giving an Account of Oneself shows us Judith Butler at her best, in dialogue with some of the other foremost thinkers of our age: Adorno, Foucault, Levinas, and Laplanche. Confronting the problem of identities that emerge only in relation to social and moral norms they may seek to contest, she proposes a rethinking of responsibility in relation to the limits of self-understanding that make us human.

Lawrence (Wordsworth Poetry Library)</h2><p>Lawrence&#39;s reputation as a novelist has often meant that his achievements in poetry have failed to receive the recognition they deserve. This edition brings together, in a form he himself sanctioned, his Collected Poems of 1928, the unexpurgated version of Pansies, and Nettles, adding to these volumes the contents of the two notebooks in which he was still writing poetry when he died in 1930. It therefore allows the reader to trace the development of Lawrence as a poet and appreciate the remarkable originality and distinctiveness of his achievement. Not all the poems reprinted here are masterpieces but there is more than enough quality to confirm Lawrence&#39;s status as one of the greatest English writers of the twentieth century.</p><p></p><h2>Getting Stoned with Savages: A Trip Through the Islands of Fiji and Vanuatu</h2><p>With <i>The Sex Lives of Cannibals</i>, Maarten Troost established himself as one of the most engaging and original travel writers around. <i>Getting Stoned with Savages</i> again reveals his wry wit and infectious joy of discovery in a side-splittingly funny account of life in the farthest reaches of the world. After two grueling years on the island of Tarawa, battling feral dogs, machete-wielding neighbors, and a lack of beer on a daily basis, Maarten Troost was in no hurry to return to the South Pacific. But as time went on, he realized he felt remarkably out of place among the trappings of twenty-first-century America. When he found himself holding down a job&#x2014;one that might possibly lead to a career&#x2014;he knew it was time for him and his wife, Sylvia, to repack their bags and set off for parts unknown.<br><i><br>Getting Stoned with Savages</i> tells the hilarious story of Troost&#x2019;s time on Vanuatu&#x2014;a rugged cluster of islands where the natives gorge themselves on kava and are still known to &#x201c;eat the man.&#x201d; Falling into one amusing misadventure after another, Troost struggles against typhoons, earthquakes, and giant centipedes and soon finds himself swept up in the laid-back, clothing-optional lifestyle of the islanders. When Sylvia gets pregnant, they decamp for slightly-more-civilized Fiji, a fallen paradise where the local chiefs can be found watching rugby in the house next door. And as they contend with new parenthood in a country rife with prostitutes and government coups, their son begins to take quite naturally to island living&#x2014;in complete contrast to his dad.</p><p>J. MAARTEN TROOST recently returned from his years in Vanuatu and Fiji. He, his wife, and their two children live in Sacramento, California.<b>chapter 1 <br></b><br><i>In which the author, much to his surprise, finds himself holding down a job, a real job that could possibly lead to a career, which causes him considerable distress as he envisions his world reduced to swirling acronyms, whereupon his beguiling wife offers him another way, an escape, an alternate road, and together they decide to move to the distant islands of the South Pacific. <br></i><br>I have been called many things in my life, but if there has been but one constant, one barb, one arrow flung my way time after time, it is the accusation that I am, in essence, nothing more than an escapist. Apparently this is bad, suspect, possibly even un-American. Mention to someone that, all things being equal, you&#x2019;d really rather be on an island in the South Pacific, and they&#x2019;ll look at you quizzically, ponder the madness of the notion for a moment, and say: &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s just escapism. Now would you kindly finish stocking the paper clips so we have time to rearrange the Hi-Liter markers? We need to make sure they&#x2019;re color-coordinated.&#x201d; <br><br>I&#x2019;m not sure where this tendency came from. Escapism, we are led to believe, is evidence of a deficiency in character, a certain failure of temperament, and like so many -isms, it is to be strenuously avoided. How do you expect to get ahead? people ask. But the question altogether misses the point. The escapist doesn&#x2019;t want to get ahead. He simply wants to get away. I understand this, for I am an unapologetic escapist. Once before, I had abandoned the life I knew in Washington, D.C., escaping the urgent din of the continental world for a distant atoll in the equatorial Pacific. I lived there for two years, never once looking at a clock, marveling at what a strange turn my life had taken<i>. I may have heat rash</i>, I thought back then,<i> and I might be hosting eight different kinds of parasites, but at least I&#x2019;m not some office drone.</i> I had escaped, I thought mirthfully as I tended to my septic infections. And then, suddenly, my life took another dramatic U-turn, and I once again found myself back in Washington, where every morning I was confronted by a debilitating decision: What tie to wear? <br><br>The dissonance was overwhelming. One day, I found myself pressed inside the Washington Metro, soaked through from a November rain, palpitating slightly as I realized I had an 8 a.m. meeting and it was presently 8:17 a.m., and just like that it occurred to me that six months earlier I could be found paddling an outrigger canoe across the sun-dappled waters of a lagoon in the South Pacific. This had been happening for some time, this juxtaposition of my former life upon my present one, and the contrast never failed to leave me twitching in bafflement. <i>How had this happened? </i>Huddled on the subway, I lingered on the image for a moment, far away, envisioning the canopy of palm trees swaying in the near distance, the urgent leap of a flying fish, the fishermen in sailing canoes returning with their catch, the brilliant, shimmering colors offered by a setting sun, until my reverie came to an abrupt end as the subway doors opened and I was swept into the tumult of the rush-hour commute. It was a disconcerting sensation. <i>Blue, blue water</i>, I thought in vain as I was shepherded onto an escalator crowded with pasty-faced suits like myself, dejected already. I tried imagining <i>swaying palm trees</i> as I scurried through the rain toward my office at the World Bank, flashing the color-coded ID card I kept tethered to my belt. Inside, I tried conjuring stress-free tropical living once I found on my chair a dreaded note from my boss: PLEASE SEE ME. 7:45 a.m. But the image was gone. <i>Poof.</i> <br><br>How had this happened? I wondered again. For two years I had lived in Kiribati, a widely dispersed scattering of atolls at the end of the world, where I had led a rather lively and adventurous existence with my girlfriend Sylvia. And now I was right back where I started, in the real world, as some prefer to call it, wondering how I might leave it again. <br><br>As I settled into my office, I noticed another note on top of my keyboard, scrawled by the office assistant: IFC MEETING IN WBIGF CONFERENCE ROOM. WHERE ARE YOU??? 8:21 a.m. The message light on my phone blinked ominously. Sighing, I loped toward the conference room, pausing briefly to catch sight of my reflection in the window, and I noted with some interest that I looked like sodden vermin. It was not going to be a good day, I knew. The conference room itself was transparent, because the World Bank values transparency, and as I approached I wondered, <i>Is that a Bank vice president sitting there? </i>Why, yes, it was<i>. Is that another one?</i> Indeed so. <i>And look, there&#x2019;s our division chief. Does he ever look pissed off.</i> I entered, and as I mumbled my apologies, my boss cut me off. &#x201c;Finally,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now we can begin. Do you have the PowerPoint slides?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Er... the PowerPoint slides... was that me?...I thought... Wasn&#x2019;t Sergio...?&#x201d; <br><br>Sergio looked upon me with serene blankness. I dampened a little further as the perspiration commingled with the rain, and as I studied the multitude of agitated faces, I thought to myself, <i>Six months ago . . .</i> <br><br>Inexplicably, six months turned into a year, and then two. Yet, that strange sense of dislocation never left me. <i>Where am I?</i> I&#x2019;d ask myself with alarming frequency. <i>How did I get here?</i> <i>What events in time and space have brought me to this moment?</i> Glancing out my office window, I&#x2019;d see limousines depositing presidents and prime ministers, Nobel laureates and eminent thinkers, even Bono himself, and I&#x2019;d remember that not so long ago I had lived in a place that could not possibly be further removed from the global stage. In Kiribati, I would gladly have given up a finger or two for a newspaper, and now here I was, surrounded by newsworthy personalities. Even my friends thought my change in circumstances odd. <br><br>&#x201c;The World Bank? You? You&#x2019;re a hoity-toity consultant to the World Bank?&#x201d; asked one. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You were unemployed for two years, and now you&#x2019;ve got this glam job at the World Bank?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t unemployed,&#x201d; I countered, pleased to hear someone describe my job as glamorous. <br><br>&#x201c;I see. And what was it you did for two years?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was writing.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Writing.&#x201d; Long pause here. &#x201c;And how much, if you don&#x2019;t mind my asking, did your writing&#x2013;and I&#x2019;m sure it was sublime&#x2013;how much money, would you say, did your writing earn you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Net?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes, net.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three hundred and fifty dollars.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Three hundred and fifty dollars.&#x201d; This was savored for a moment. &#x201c;Two years. Three hundred and fifty dollars.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Three hundred and fifty American dollars.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Three hundred and fifty American dollars, then. And now you advise countries, entire countries, on what they should do with their money.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Actually, my boss does that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And so what do you do?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I help him.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You help him. And for this help, you are no doubt handsomely remunerated.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t complain.&#x201d; <br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t, really. For the first time in my life I had more money than I knew what to do with. This, like so much else, was a startling change in circumstances. For years I had lived the easy poverty of the vagabond. And just as everyone else was boarding the Internet money train, I disappeared to the far side of the world, where I lived as a financial parasite while hacking away at a novel that meandered into failure. Money&#x2013;the possession thereof&#x2013;should have made me giddy with joy. And it did. For a day. The day I saw my bank account surge into the four figures, which seemed a stratospheric sum. But then, what to do with it? I mean, after the restaurant splurges. And your need for Paris has been sated. Where do you put it? In stocks? Bonds? That&#x2019;s what I did. And here&#x2019;s the funny thing. Then you begin to worry about money. To my everlasting disappointment, I discovered that it&#x2019;s true what they say. Money doesn&#x2019;t buy you happiness. <br><br>Damn it. <br>It was all so very baffling to me. I had money. I had a respectable job. If I tried just a little bit harder and played my cards right, I could turn my consultancy into a permanent staff position and then I would be set for life. I could move on from WBILG to WBOPA, maybe even to WBPCL. And from there all sorts of possibilities opened up: UNDP, EBRD, IMF, ADB, maybe even a job with the bad boys over at IFC. Well, perhaps not the IFC. That meeting had not gone very well. Not at all. I had made my boss look bad, a big no-no at the World Bank. But still, if I simply applied myself, I could count on lifetime employment as a well-compensated international bureaucrat with all the perks the job entailed. There would be busi-ness-class travel and six weeks of annual vacation. There would be health insurance and an extremely generous pension. And best of all, I could never, ever be fired. Once encased within the United Nations system, a staffer is guaranteed lifetime employment, perhaps not as a rule, but most certainly in practice. The office next to mine, for instance, was occupied by a Korean gentleman who, as far as anyone could tell, had not produced even a suggestion of work in well over three years. Some days he showed up, some days not, and yet every year his salary percolated ever upward. It wasn&#x2019;t quite what I aspired to, but I did recognize that there are much, much worse ways to make a living. <br><br>Yet, I didn&#x2019;t apply myself any harder. Instead, as I stared forlornly at my computer screen, trying halfheartedly to decipher a complex economic equation (&#x201c;No math,&#x201d; I had told them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m one hundred percent right brain&#x201d;), I found that very soon, once again, my thoughts drifted toward the Pacific. Two years ago, I remembered, I was on an outer island in Kiribati, resting in a thatch-roofed meeting house and chatting amiably with an elderly man about the dozens of shark fins drying in the rafters. I didn&#x2019;t think much of it at the time. It was just a normal day in Kiribati. But now, as I perused my wall, the stacks of heavy binders with titles <i>like Privatization and the Energy Sector and Infrastructure Finance: A Global Challenge</i>, binders piled so high that they nearly covered the ubiquitous Monet print&#x2013;how I hated those lilies&#x2013;I found that I nearly ached at the recollection. Once, my world had been filled with wonder and mystery. I lived surrounded by water so blue that I sometimes gasped at the beauty of it. I knew magicians and sorcerers. I slept under multitudes of stars and finally understood what is meant by the spiritual world. I . . . <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re forgetting the human feces on the beach,&#x201d; said my wife, Sylvia, a little later, just as my exposition was beginning to roll. Sylvia was the girlfriend I had followed to Kiribati. We had faked marriage there, and after two years of practice we felt we had earned the rings. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re also forgetting ringworm, dengue fever, and &#x2018;La Macarena.&#x2019; And do you remember when the beer was sent to the wrong island? You weren&#x2019;t waxing poetic then. And the food&#x2013; months of nothing but rice and rotten fish. Do you remember that Christmas package your dad sent, the one with all the cookies and chocolate?&#x201d;<br> <br>Indeed I did. It was a Christmas tradition begun by my grandmother in Holland. Every year, she sent us packages containing the buttery sweets and milky chocolates that the Dutch excel in producing. My father had taken up the tradition after my grandmother passed away. The package he sent had taken seven months to reach us in Kiribati, and by the time it arrived more than half its contents had been consumed by rats, with the remainder scarred by claws and fangs. It never occurred to us not to eat it. We devoured the remaining half in one long gluttonous afternoon, feeling nothing but blissful rapture. <br><br>&#x201c;But wasn&#x2019;t that the best chocolate you ever had?&#x201d; I asked. <br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she sighed. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s the point. I never want to feel that desperate again.&#x201d; <br><br>She did have a point. Escapism is not without its costs. Life had been desperate in Kiribati. Whatever hopes we&#x2019;d had of finding the South Seas idyll of our imagination were cruelly dashed by the realities of island living. True, it had been beautiful. But it had also been hard. Living in a state of perpetual denial, as we did in Kiribati, had a way of heightening one&#x2019;s appreciation of the small things, like chocolate. But strangely, I didn&#x2019;t appreciate chocolate anymore. Indeed, I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time I&#x2019;d even <i>had </i>chocolate, and for some reason, this had begun to bother me, for what is life, a good life, but the accumulation of small pleasures? In Washington, we lived in a place where everything was available, for a price, and yet I couldn&#x2019;t recall the last time I had really savored something&#x2013;a book, a sunset, a fine meal. It was as if the sensory overload that is American life had somehow led to sensory deprivation, a gilded weariness, where everything is permitted and nothing appreciated. I&#x2019;d find myself inside a Whole Foods, and remember that not long ago I would have engaged in all sorts of criminality for a chance to skip down these heaving aisles, yet now I found myself feeling a mite peeved that the cheese selection wasn&#x2019;t quite as expansive as I would have wished. In Kiribati I yearned for all that we had in Washington&#x2013;high-end grocery stores, reliable electricity, endless consumer choice&#x2013;and now that I was in the midst of all this bounty, I pined for what we had in Kiribati, the intangibles at least, for there are no tangibles to be found on a remote atoll.</p><h2>Shell Shaker</h2><p>Fiction.

This audio documentary about the American cuisine enjoyed during the Great Depression comes from the author&#39;s research into manuscripts written under Roosevelt&#39;s WPA, the Works Project Administration. Narrator Stephen Hoye reads hundreds of recipes, making them more palatable with his nuanced pronunciation of ingredients and lively renditions of cooks describing their preparation of traditional meals. He imitates the African-American speech of the Old South so well that he must occasionally translate his own words into contemporary English.

One truth prevails: the sheer scale of the evils that he unleashed on the world has made him a demonic figure without equal in this century. Ian Kershaw's Hitler brings us closer than ever before to the character of the bizarre misfit in his thirty-year ascent from a Viennese shelter for the indigent to uncontested rule over the German nation that had tried and rejected democracy in the crippling aftermath of World War I. With extraordinary vividness, Kershaw recreates the settings that made Hitler's rise possible: the virulent anti-Semitism of prewar Vienna, the crucible of a war with immense casualties, the toxic nationalism that gripped Bavaria in the 1920s, the undermining of the Weimar Republic by extremists of the Right and the Left, the hysteria that accompanied Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 and then mounted in brutal attacks by his storm troopers on Jews and others condemned as enemies of the Aryan race. In an account drawing on many previously untapped sources, Hitler metamorphoses from an obscure fantasist, a "drummer" sounding an insistent beat of hatred in Munich beer halls, to the instigator of an infamous failed putsch and, ultimately, to the leadership of a ragtag alliance of right-wing parties fused into a movement that enthralled the German people.</p><p>This volume, the first of two, ends with the promulgation of the infamous Nuremberg laws that pushed German Jews to the outer fringes of society, and with the march of the German army into the Rhineland, Hitler's initial move toward the abyss of war.</p> Black-and-white photos throughout</p><p>Noted for his excellent structural explanation of the Third Reich's political culture in <i>The Hitler Myth</i>, eminent historian Ian Kershaw shifts approach in this innovative biography of the Nazi tyrant. The first of a two-volume study, <i>Hubris</i> is far from a simple rehearsal of "great man" history, impressively exploring the historical forces that transformed a shiftless Austrian daydreamer into a dictator with immense power.<p> In his forthright introduction, Kershaw acknowledges that, as a committed social historian, he did not include biography in his original intellectual plans. However, his "growing preoccupation" with the structures of Nazi domination pushed him toward questions about Hitler's place and considerable authority within that system. He argues that the sources for Hitler's power must be sought not only in the dictator's actions but also (and more importantly) in the social circumstances of a nation that allowed him to overstep all institutional and moral barriers. In a comprehensive treatment of Hitler's life and times up through the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936, Kershaw draws from documents recently made available from Russian archives and benefits from a rigorous source criticism that has discredited many records formerly understood to be reliable. <i>Hubris</i> thus supplants Alan Bullock's classic <i>Hitler: A Study in Tyranny</i> as the definitive account of a man who, with characteristic smugness, indicated that it was a divinely inspired history that made him: "I go with the certainty of a sleep walker along a path laid out for me by Providence." Kershaw's penetrating analysis of how such a certain path could emerge from the dire circumstances of post World War I Germany is the abiding strength of <i>Hubris</i>. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>Ian Kershaw is a professor of modern history at the University of Sheffield and the author of numerous works of history, including Hitler: A Biography, Fateful Choices and Hitler, the Germans, and the Final Solution.

Adding to his frustration, his mail had been cut off.</p><p>Back inside, as the rains pelted his red shingle roof, spinning the dove-of-peace weathervane, the President bent over his candlelit desk, dipped a quill in black ink and tensely scratched out letter after letter. He was feeling "serious anxiety" in a time of "trouble and perplexities."</p><p>For twenty years, since the start of the Revolution, he had taken as his due the bands playing "The Hero Comes!" and the lightstruck Americans cheering "the man who unites all hearts." His anointment as President by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792 had been unanimous.</p><p>But now the national adoration for Washington was fading. Americans had learned that a secret treaty negotiated by his envoy John Jay made demands that many found humiliating. One member of Congress said the fury against "that damned treaty" was moving "like an electric velocity to every state in the Union."</p><p>As the public tempest had swelled, some wanted Washington impeached. Cartoons showed the President being marched to a guillotine. Even in the President's beloved Virginia, Revolutionary veterans raised glasses and cried, "A speedy Death to General Washington!"</p><p>With the national surge of anger toward Washington, some Americans complained that he was living as luxuriously as George III, the monarch they had fought a revolution to escape. Using old forgeries, several columnists insisted that Washington had been secretly bribed during the war by British agents.</p><p>Still others charged that the President stole military credit from soldiers who had bled and died: "With what justice do you monopolize the glories of the American Revolution?"</p><p>Reeling from the blows, the sixty-three-year-old Washington wrote that the "infamous scribblers" were calling him "a common pickpocket" in "such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero."</p><p>One still-friendly gazette moaned, "Washington has been classed with tyrants, and calumniated as the enemy of his country. Weep for the national character of America, for, in ingratitude to her Washington, it is sullied and debased throughout the globe!"</p><p>President Washington had brought the national furor upon himself by trying to avert a new war with Great Britain that threatened to strangle his infant nation in its cradle.</p><p>In the spring of 1794, the British were arming Indians and spurring them to attack Americans trying to settle the new frontier lands that would one day include Ohio and Michigan. London was reneging on its pledge, made in the peace treaty ending the Revolutionary War, to vacate royal forts in the trans-Appalachian West -- Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michilimackinac.</p><p>Since Britain was at war with France, British captains seized U.S. ships trading with the French West Indies. Renouncing the agreed-upon border between the U.S. and Canada, Britain's governor in Quebec predicted a new Anglo-American war "within a year."</p><p>Former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who hated England and adored France, demanded retaliation against the British. But Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton warned the President not to plunge into a war that America could not win.</p><p>The religious Martha Washington could not abide Hamilton's Byzantine intrigues or his infidelities to his wife, Elizabeth. When Martha adopted a tomcat, she named it "Hamilton."</p><p>But for the President, who knew his own shortcomings, Hamilton was an endless fount of provocative ideas, tactics and language.</p><p>During his first term, Washington had told Hamilton and Jefferson that their gladiatorial clashes over foreign policy, economics and personalities were "tearing our vitals" and had to stop.</p><p>Instead, Jefferson quit in 1793 and organized an opposition. The new political chasm between Federalists and Jefferson's Republicans killed Washington's old dream of eternal national unity with no need for political parties.</p><p>Retaining the President's ear, Hamilton urged him to send an "envoy extraordinary" to London. A new Anglo-American treaty could secure U.S. trade on the Atlantic and the Great Lakes, giving their country time to build its economy and defenses and settle its frontier. Then if America one day had to fight off Britain, it would be far better prepared.</p><p>Washington agreed, but he knew Hamilton must not be the envoy. That would inflame the Jeffersonians. Instead, at Hamilton's suggestion, he chose the aristocratic Chief Justice, John Jay of New York.</p><p>Privately Jay warned his wife that America might well have to battle England. But in May 1794, before sailing from lower Manhattan to London, he promised a cheering crowd he would do "everything" to "secure the blessings of peace." Soon after Jay's departure, the British reclaimed and fortified one of their old posts on American territory near Detroit.</p><p>Having jeopardized his prestige to talk with Britain, Washington was furious. He wrote Jay it was "the most open and daring act of British agents in America." Every "well informed" American knew that the British were instigating "all the difficulties that we encounter with the Indians...the murders of helpless women and innocent children."</p><p>He noted that some wished him to turn the other cheek: "I answer NO!...It will be impossible to keep this country in a state of amity with G. Britain long if the Posts are not surrendered."</p><p>Jay got the British to forgo such aggravations while they bargained. He assured Washington that Britain felt it was having a "family quarrel" with America, "and that it is Time it should be made up."</p><p>Jay reported that, excepting the King, the British respected no one more than George Washington. With such "perfect and universal Confidence" in Washington's "personal character," they had taken Jay's presence in London "as a strong Proof of your Desire to preserve Peace."</p><p>By the start of 1795, Washington heard rumors that Jay had managed to broker a treaty, but the expected dispatch case never arrived.</p><p>As it turned out, after making a deal in November, Jay had sent the President two copies of the treaty documents by a British ship that was seized by the French on the Atlantic. British sailors had thrown the papers overboard to keep them from French hands.</p><p>That spring, another ship brought duplicates to Norfolk, Virginia. By stagecoach and horseback, a mud-caked, frostbitten messenger rushed them to Philadelphia, where Washington received them at the President's House at 190 High Street.</p><p>In 1790, when Washington and his government moved from New York City to the temporary capital of Philadelphia, there was no official mansion for the President.</p><p>Thus the great man paid three thousand dollars a year to rent the four-story red-brick house owned by Robert Morris, financier of the Revolution and Senator from Pennsylvania.* Morris graciously moved next door to accommodate his old friend.</p><p>Washington found it "the best Single house in the City" but still "inadequate" for him. For instance, there were "good stables, but for twelve horses only."</p><p>During renovations, which Washington financed, a house painter allegedly attacked one of the President's housemaids, who shrieked. Face daubed with shaving cream, the half-dressed Washington was said to have kicked the painter down the stairs, crying, "I will have no woman insulted in my house!"</p><p>The President's servants included eight black slaves selected from the almost three hundred who lived at Mount Vernon. Knowing that Pennsylvania law freed any slave residing there for six months or more, Washington and Martha made sure that each of their slaves was quietly sent home to Virginia every five months or so.</p><p>"I wish to have it accomplished under pretext that I may deceive both them and the Public," the General wrote a trusted aide, insisting that the ruse "be known to none but yourself and Mrs. Washington."</p><p>Upstairs at his mansion, Washington frowned at Jay's "Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation." He knew that if he approved it, Americans would excoriate him for truckling to their old oppressor across the sea.</p><p>Most inflammatory was Article Twelve: America could trade with the West Indies, but not with large vessels. Nor could the U.S. export any products natural to those islands.</p><p>Jay's deal would also cosset the lucrative British fur trade in the American Northwest. The U.S. would pledge never to seize British assets in America, surrendering an important potential weapon for America's defense.</p><p>The treaty would also allow the British to keep on halting U.S. exports to France -- and to escape paying reparations for American slaves they had carried off during the Revolutionary War.</p><p>To keep public indignation from building against the treaty before he sent it to the Senate, Washington ordered Secretary of State Edmund Randolph to keep its contents "rigidly" secret "from every person on earth" -- even the rest of his Cabinet.</p><p>Unlike his successors, Washington took literally the Constitution's demand that a President ask the Senate's "advice and consent" on treaties.

Both Loeb and Lee have large fan followings, Loeb for his thoughtful takes on iconic superheroes, and Lee for his flashy, dynamic artwork. This book collects the second half of their 12-issue run on <i>Batman</i>, picking up where volume 1 [BKL Jl 03] left off. The story line is set in motion by a mysterious foe who is manipulating Batman's familiar villains, and that gives Loeb and Lee opportunity for distinctive versions, in this book, of Joker, Riddler, and Clayface as well as former villainess Catwoman, now embarked on a tentative romance with the Caped Crusader. For all the hype surrounding <i>Hush</i>, both volumes are built largely around the standard brawling by which, fairly or not, the superhero genre has long been characterized. Which is no deterrent to the wild popularity both volumes should enjoy. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Bedford (Everyman&#39;s Library Children&#39;s Classics Series)</h2><p>Peter, Wendy, Captain Hook, the lost boys, and Tinker Bell have filled the hearts of children ever since Barrie&#39;s play first opened in London in 1904 and became an immediate sensation. Now this funny, haunting modern myth is presented with Bedford&#39;s wonderful illustrations, which first appeared in the author&#39;s own day, have long been out of print, and have never been equaled.</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Top scholars--like the late John Boswell of Yale, Daniel Boyarin of Berkeley, Bernadette Brooten of Brandeis, L.William Countryman of the Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Victor P. Furnish of SMU, Saul M. Olyan of Brown and Robin Scruggs of Union Theological Seminary--show that those who perceive Bible passages as condemning homosexuality are being misled by faulty translation and poor interpretation...... Danial A. Helminiak, Ph.D. respected theologian and Roman Catholic priest, explains in a clear fashion the fascinating new insights of these scholars...... The Bible has been used to justify slavery, inquisitions, apartheid and the subjugation of women. Now, in this books which has sold over 100 thousand copies, read what the Bible really says about homosexuality.</p><p>Believing that the translation of the Bible they use consists of the inerrant word of God, some Christians cite a handful of passages to justify their condemnation of homosexuality. But historical biblical scholarship holds that these believers' conception of inerrancy is naively based, for English versions of the originally Hebrew and Greek scriptures are rife with problematic translations. Some scholars further maintain that the supposedly antihomosexual passages are not blanket condemnations of homosexual persons and acts. Indeed, in some cases, these verses aren't about homosexuality at all; they meant quite different things to those for whom they were first written, peoples whose social conceptions of sexuality were vastly different from ours. Helminiak provides cogent, accessible precis of these revisionist findings on the Bible's six major passages and few minor references that seem to denounce homosexuality. The Bible does not condemn gay sex as we understand it today, he concludes; those who seek to know outright if gay or lesbian sex is good or evil . . . will have to look elsewhere for an answer. An extremely valuable contribution to popular gay and biblical studies. <i>Ray Olson</i>Helminiak, a Roman Catholic priest, has done careful reading in current biblical scholarship about homosexuality. While cautioning against viewing biblical teaching as "the last word on sexual ethics," he stresses the need for accurate understanding of what the biblical "facts" are and concludes that "the Bible supplies no real basis for the condemnation of homosexuality." Using the studies of Yale historian John Boswell (Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe, LJ 7/94), New Testament seminary professor L. William Countryman, and others, Helminiak examines the story of Sodom (where the sin was inhospitality), Jude's decrying sex with angels, and five texts-Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, Romans 1:27, I Corinthians 6:9, and I Timothy 1:10-all of which, he concludes, "are concerned with something other than homogenital activity itself."

The first sentence of the first story, "Love Is Not a Pie," evinces the contradictions, layers, and interconnections of her narrator's existence--and hooks the reader entirely. "In the middle of the eulogy at my mother's boring and heart-breaking funeral, I began to think about calling off the wedding." The title phrase means exactly what it says: Lila's mother didn't have a finite amount of affection and was lucky not to be forced to choose between love's accepted forms and a more unusual one: "People think that it can't be that way, but it can. You just have to find the right people." Lila realizes that she needs to get out of her engagement because she isn't ready for normality. <p> The unusual pervades these stories, and Bloom handles some outsized events with delicacy and humor. In "Sleepwalking," a new widow sends her stepson away after they've slept together, because she wants him to have a normal life. The author makes us aware that there's something terrible and foolhardy about this woman's decision. Several other characters find themselves in equally desperate situations, their only consolation being recollections of earlier bliss, often sensual: "It was like nothing else in my life, that river of love that I could dip into and leave and return to once more and find it still flowing." For them, memories of past happiness makes present sorrow bearable.</p>Amy Bloom is the author of two novels, three collections of short stories, and a nominee for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. She has written for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, among many other publications, and has won a National Magazine Award.

If you think you know the story, you know only half the truth. Get ready for the mystery, the myth, the terror, and the magic of...<br><br><b>Dean Koontz's Prodigal Son<br></b><br>Every city has secrets. But none as terrible as this. His name is Deucalion, a tattooed man of mysterious origin, a sleight-of-reality artist who&#x2019;s traveled the centuries with a secret worse than death. He arrives as a serial killer stalks the streets, a killer who carefully selects his victims for the humanity that is missing in himself. Detective Carson O&#x2019;Connor is cool, cynical, and every bit as tough as she looks. Her partner Michael Maddison would back her up all the way to Hell itself&#x2013;and that just may be where this case ends up. For the no-nonsense O&#x2019;Connor is suddenly talking about an ages-old conspiracy, a near immortal race of beings, and killers that are more&#x2014;and less&#x2014;than human. Soon it will be clear that as crazy as she sounds, the truth is even more ominous. For their quarry isn&#x2019;t merely a homicidal maniac&#x2014;but his deranged maker.</p><p>Dean Koontz, the author of many #1<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives with his wife, Gerda, and the enduring spirit of their golden retriever, Trixie, in southern California.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><i>Chapter One</i><br><br>Deucalion seldom slept, but when he did, he dreamed. Every dream was a nightmare. None frightened him. He was the spawn of nightmares, after all; and he had been toughened by a life of terror.<br><br>During the afternoon, napping in his simple cell, he dreamed that a surgeon opened his abdomen to insert a mysterious, squirming mass. Awake but manacled to the surgical table, Deucalion could only endure the procedure.<br><br>After he had been sewn shut, he felt something crawling inside his body cavity, as though curious, exploring.<br>From behind his mask, the surgeon said, &#x201c;A messenger approaches. Life changes with a letter.&#x201d;<br><br>He woke from the dream and knew that it had been prophetic. He possessed no psychic power of a classic nature, but sometimes omens came in his sleep.<br><br>In these mountains of tibet, a fiery sunset conjured a mirage of molten gold from the glaciers and the snowfields. A serrated blade of Himalayan peaks, with Everest at its hilt, cut the sky.<br><br>Far from civilization, this vast panorama soothed Deucalion. For several years, he had preferred to avoid people, except for Buddhist monks in this windswept rooftop of the world.<br><br>Although he had not killed for a long time, he still harbored the capacity for homicidal fury. Here he strove always to suppress his darker urges, sought calm, and hoped to find true peace.<br><br>From an open stone balcony of the whitewashed monastery, as he gazed at the sun-splashed ice pack, he considered, not for the first time, that these two elements, fire and ice, defined his life.<br><br>At his side, an elderly monk, Nebo, asked, &#x201c;Are you looking at the mountains&#x2014;or beyond them, to what you left behind?&#x201d;<br><br>Although Deucalion had learned to speak several Tibetan dialects during his lengthy sojourn here, he and the old monk often spoke English, for it afforded them privacy.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t miss much of that world. The sea. The sound of shore birds. A few friends. Cheez-Its.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cheeses? We have cheese here.&#x201d;<br><br>Deucalion smiled and pronounced the word more clearly than he&#x2019;d done previously. &#x201c;Cheez-Its are cheddar-flavored crackers. Here in this monastery we seek enlightenment, meaning, purpose . . . God. Yet often the humblest things of daily life, the small pleasures, seem to define existence for me. I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m a shallow student, Nebo.&#x201d;<br><br>Pulling his wool robe closer about himself as wintry breezes bit, Nebo said, &#x201c;To the contrary. Never have I had one less shallow than you. Just hearing about Cheez-Its, I myself am intrigued.&#x201d;<br><br>A voluminous wool robe covered Deucalion&#x2019;s scarred patchwork body, though even the harshest cold rarely bothered him.<br>The mandala-shaped Rombuk monastery&#x2014;an architectural wonder of brick walls, soaring towers, and graceful roofs&#x2014;clung precariously to a barren mountainside: imposing, majestic, hidden from the world. Waterfalls of steps spilled down the sides of the square towers, to the base of the main levels, granting access to interior courtyards.<br><br>Brilliant yellow, white, red, green, and blue prayer flags, representing the elements, flapped in the breeze. Carefully written sutras adorned the flags, so that each time the fabric waved in the wind, a prayer was symbolically sent in the direction of Heaven.<br><br>Despite Deucalion&#x2019;s size and strange appearance, the monks had accepted him. He absorbed their teaching and filtered it through his singular experience. In time, they had come to him with philosophical questions, seeking his unique perspective.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t know who he was, but they understood intuitively that he was no normal man.<br><br>Deucalion stood for a long time without speaking. Nebo waited beside him. Time had little meaning in the clockless world of the monks, and after two hundred years of life, with perhaps more than that ahead of him, Deucalion often lived with no awareness of time.<br><br>Prayer wheels clicked, stirred by breezes. In a call to sunset prayer, one monk stood in the window of a high tower, blowing on a shell trumpet. Deep inside the monastery, chants began to resonate through the cold stone.<br><br>Deucalion stared down into the canyons full of purple twilight, east of the monastery. From some of Rombuk&#x2019;s windows, one might fall more than a thousand feet to the rocks.<br><br>Out of that gloaming, a distant figure approached.<br>&#x201c;A messenger,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The surgeon in the dream spoke truth.&#x201d;<br>The old monk could not at first see the visitor. His eyes, the color of vinegar, seemed to have been faded by the unfiltered sun of extreme altitude. Then they widened. &#x201c;We must meet him at the gates.&#x201d;<br><br>Salamanders of torchlight crawled the ironbound beams of the main gate and the surrounding brick walls.<br>Just inside the gates, standing in the open-air outer ward, the messenger regarded Deucalion with awe. &#x201c;Yeti,&#x201d; he whispered, which was the name that the Sherpas had coined for the abominable snowman.<br><br>Words escaping him on plumes of frosted breath, Nebo said, &#x201c;Is it custom now to precede a message with a rude remark?&#x201d;<br><br>Having once been pursued like a beast, having lived two hundred years as the ultimate outsider, Deucalion was inoculated against all meanness. He was incapable of taking offense.<br><br>&#x201c;Were I a yeti,&#x201d; he said, speaking in the messenger&#x2019;s language, &#x201c;I might be as tall as this.&#x201d; He stood six feet six. &#x201c;I might be muscled this solidly. But I would be much hairier, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I . . . I suppose so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A yeti never shaves.&#x201d; Leaning close, as if imparting a secret, Deucalion said, &#x201c;Under all that hair, a yeti has very sensitive skin. Pink, soft . . . quick to take a rash from a razor blade.&#x201d;<br><br>Summoning courage, the messenger asked, &#x201c;Then what are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Big Foot,&#x201d; Deucalion said in English, and Nebo laughed, but the messenger did not understand.<br>Made nervous by the monk&#x2019;s laughter, shivering not only because of the icy air, the young man held out a scuffed goatskin packet knotted tightly with a leather thong. &#x201c;Here. Inside. For you.&#x201d;<br><br>Deucalion curled one powerful finger around the leather thong, snapped it, and unfolded the goatskin wrapping to reveal an envelope inside, a wrinkled and stained letter long in transit.<br><br>The return address was in New Orleans. The name was that of an old and trusted friend, Ben Jonas.<br><br>Still glancing surreptitiously and nervously at the ravaged half of Deucalion&#x2019;s face, the messenger evidently decided that the company of a yeti would be preferable to a return trip in darkness through the bitter-cold mountain pass. &#x201c;May I have shelter for the night?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyone who comes to these gates,&#x201d; Nebo assured him, &#x201c;may have whatever he needs. If we had them, I would even give you Cheez-Its.&#x201d;<br><br>From the outer ward, they ascended the stone ramp through the inner gate. Two young monks with lanterns arrived as if in answer to a telepathic summons to escort the messenger to guest quarters.<br><br>In the candlelit reception hall, in an alcove that smelled of sandalwood and incense, Deucalion read the letter. Ben&#x2019;s handwritten words conveyed a momentous message in neatly penned blue ink.</p><h2>Hannah&#39;s Child: A Theologian&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>A loving, hard-working, godly couple has long been denied a family of their own. Finally, the wife makes a deal with God: if he blesses her with a child, she will dedicate that child to God&#x2019;s service. The result of that prayer was the birth of an influential -- some say prophetic -- voice. Surprisingly, this is not the biblical story of Samuel but the account of Stanley Hauerwas, one of today&#x2019;s leading theologians in the church and the academy. The story of Hauerwas&#x2019;s journey into Christian discipleship is captivating and inspiring. With genuine humility, he describes his intellectual struggles with faith, how he has dealt with the complex reality of marriage to a mentally ill partner, and the gift of friendships that have influenced his character. Throughout the narrative shines Hauerwas&#x2019;s conviction that the tale of his life is worth telling only because of the greater Christian story providing foundation and direction for his own.</p><p>Stanley Hauerwas is Gilbert T. Rowe Professor Emeritus of Divinity and Law at Duke University. Among his many books are <i>Resident Aliens, A Community of Character, Living Gently in a Violent World,</i> and <i>A Cross-Shattered Church.</i><b>Jeffrey Stout</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton University<br> "<i>Hannah's Child</i>&nbsp;might well be Stanley Hauerwas's best book. It is must reading for everyone who knows him, either firsthand or through his other writings."<br><br><b>Lauren F. Winner</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Girl Meets God</i><br> "I love this book because I love its author. But&nbsp;<i>Hannah's Child</i>&nbsp;is about more than the making of someone called 'Stanley Hauerwas.' It is about how one makes and sustains families, and how God and the church make and sustain Christians."<br><br><b>Lisa Sowle Cahill</b><br> &#x2014; Boston College<br> "Stanley Hauerwas is the established theologian of Christian faithfulness, perseverance, sacrifice, and the dependence of life's meaning on a coherent narrative, communally sustained. This memoir from the heart teaches further lessons: marriage and family life test faithfulness sorely, and families often bear burdens &#x2014; here, mental illness &#x2014; from which no one escapes unscathed, identity intact. In the end, though, we hear Hauerwas's voice in a new key: praise and joy for love and healing that come as gifts of grace."<br><br><b>Archbishop Rowan Williams</b><br> "What does it mean to become a Christian? Stanley Hauerwas has written a deeply engaging and courageous memoir that answers the question in terms of his own lifelong discovery of God's presence and challenge through experience both of grace and of darkness, often inseparably bound together. A book of profound compassion, depth and wisdom from one of the greatest Christian minds of our time."<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> "A rural Texas boy grows up to become&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;magazine's 'best theologian in America' &#x2014; that's the unlikely story behind Hauerwas's arguably destined journey to academic fame. Hauerwas (<i>Resident Aliens</i>) learns that his mother, like Hannah in the Book of Samuel, prayed for the blessing of a child whom she would offer to be in God's service. The theologian then weaves a compelling narrative that incorporates his humble beginnings as the son of a bricklayer, his troubled first marriage to a mentally ill woman, and his industrious intellectual pursuits. The result is a memoir that is both a well-documented story of Christian renewal and a superbly candid investigation into the scholarly mind. Fans of Christian memoirs will be pleased with Hauerwas's frank yet poignant style, and those who are simply fans of the memoir genre will find the book's careful blend of faith and scholarship easily accessible and far from didactic."<br><br><b>Graham Ward</b><br> &#x2014; University of Manchester<br> "This is a beautiful book and nothing less than a theological anthropology: the formation of a Christian Soul. It is honest, perceptive, cutting through cant, witty and intelligent &#x2014; all the characteristics we have come to expect of Stanley Hauerwas as a public intellectual. But the best that can be said of it is that even if Stanley Hauerwas was not Stanley Hauerwas, this book would be a theological gift. I put aside the novel I was reading to finish it, immersed in a lifetime of Christian experience distilled into wisdom, and moved by the sheer humanity of it all."<br><br><b>Sarah Coakley</b><br> &#x2014; University of Cambridge<br> "In this entrancing memoir, Stanley Hauerwas reflects on what he sees as the successes and failures of his life as one of the most celebrated theological ethicists of his time. It is, of course, the accounts of his perceived personal failures that are the most testing and moving: what breaks and stops even his own best motivations and intentions are the stuff of profound Christian reflection. This little autobiography follows triumphantly in the Augustinian tradition of 'Confessions.' "<br><br><b>Alister E. McGrath</b><br> &#x2014; King's College London<br> "A gripping work, packed with insight, passion, and wisdom. Hauerwas tells the story of his own life in a disarming way, exploring the interplay of theology and life with consummate skill. Few theologians would dare write a book of this kind; Hauerwas manages it precisely because he is so<i>interesting</i>. Highly recommended."<br><br><b>Alan Torrance</b><br> &#x2014; University of St. Andrews<br> "Courageous, candid and characteristically incisive, this memoir is an invaluable resource for understanding the world's most influential theological ethicist. His reflections on relationships are honest, humorous and often profoundly moving. His telling critiques of the abuse of power in universities are accompanied by impressive testimony to collegial integrity and support. Personally uplifting and theologically inspiring, this is an immensely enjoyable read!"<br><br><b>Giles Fraser</b><br> &#x2014; St. Paul's Cathedral<br> "Both painfully honest and intellectually daring, Hauerwas places his own story alongside that of his theology to create a magnificent autobiography. Some would call this testimony, others narrative theology at its most convincing. I'd just say it was utterly brilliant."<br><br><b>John Milbank</b><br> &#x2014; University of Nottingham<br> "Stanley Hauerwas, the most important living influence in Anglo-Saxon theology, has given us the story of his journey from blue-collar origins to the heights of academia, in tones that are remarkably at once candid and restrained. The tale has the ring of entire authenticity and it had to be written because Hauerwas's work of writing and his work upon himself are so clearly, as with Michel de Montaigne, one and the same. But in either case, as this book reveals, the work is really an attention and a receiving."<br><br><b>Enda McDonagh</b><br> &#x2014; Maynooth<br> "From Texan bricklayer to Duke University Professor to internationally renowned Christian Ethicist, Stanley Hauerwas remains a force of nature and grace in the theological world. This memoir, faithful as ever to his roots in title and content, provides personally moving and intellectually exciting insights into Stanley and his work for (critical?) admirers. It should also help his severer critics to understand better and appreciate more this complex and gifted man."<br><br><b>Nicholas Lash</b><br> &#x2014; University of Cambridge<br> "Stanley Hauerwas's mother, remembering the story of Hannah, prayed to God and dedicated to God the son that was born. Writing this book &#x2014; not he insists, an autobiography, perhaps a 'memoir' or even, he suggests, 'testimony' &#x2014; helped him to recognise that he was Hannah's child. Written with searing honesty about his friends, his enemies, his life and work, the darkest chapters narrate the long years of mental illness of his first wife."<br><br><b>Ann Loades</b><br> &#x2014; University of Durham<br> "A passion for truth-telling, an impeccably clear writing-style, the capacity to go on putting one foot in front of the other no matter what, an inexhaustible energy and appetite for reading, thinking, talking, writing &#x2014; all these are characteristics of Stanley Hauerwas. So is his love for all those who have made it possible for him to understand himself and his coming to be the Christian that he is. Some memoir! Some theologian!"<br><br><b>Conor Cunningham</b><br> &#x2014; University of Nottingham<br> "<i>Hannah's Child</i>&nbsp;is a fantastic read that shifts from outright hilarity to profundity seamlessly.

A whole generation of theologians has been inspired and provoked by Hauerwas and without him the intellectual landscape of twenty-first-century theology would be unrecognizable, and thus impoverished; for this reason, among others, we are all Hannah's grandchildren!"<br><br><b>Fergus Kerr OP</b><br> &#x2014; Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford<br> "Few theologians since Augustine of Hippo have ever tried to put it into words, but there is an internal connection between theology and autobiography: thinking seriously about God is inseparable from self-discovery, as this often funny and sometimes very moving book demonstrates, with the lucidity and raw honesty that one would expect from the author."<br><br><b>Jane Williams</b><br> &#x2014; St. Mellitus College<br> "<i>Hannah's Child</i>, like St. Augustine's&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>, is a theological testimony. It is a story of the vitality and thrill of theology, and of the patient, humourous attention of God. As God attends to Stanley Hauerwas, Hannah's child, so the rest of us can begin to understand how God might attend to us, too. Normally, to read a book by and about someone who is a greater thinker, Christian and human being than the reader is a depressing experience. But this is an exhilarating, inspiring, laugh out loud, cry out loud read. By the end of the book, Hauerwas says that what he has learned from writing autobiography is that he is a Christian. What we learn from reading it is that we would like to be, too."<br><br><b>Luke Bretherton</b><br> &#x2014; King's College London<br> "In the tradition of Augustine's&nbsp;<i>Confessions</i>&nbsp;this extraordinary and compelling book is autobiography as theology. With searing candour and simplicity of speech, Hauerwas set out his journey into faith &#x2014; a journey that bears witness to what it means to live truthfully amid both great personal pain and the intellectual struggles and challenges confronting Christianity in the contemporary context. An essential insight into what it means to undertake the work of theology today."<br><br><b>Linda Hogan</b><br> &#x2014; Trinity College Dublin<br> "This searingly honest, searching, sometimes infuriating book captures brilliantly why Stanley Hauerwas continues to be a theologian of note. His sorrows and failings are discussed with as much insight as are his joys and triumphs so that the life that is disclosed is filled with complexity yet characterized by simplicity. Part memoir, part testimony,&nbsp;<i>Hannah's Child</i>&nbsp;is intelligible finally in and through the Christian faith that has marked it, that has marked him, so profoundly."</p><h2>Chimera</h2><p>The comic adventures of Dunyazade, Perseus, and Bellerophon reveal the author&#39;s thoughts on the nature of a hero and relationships between men and women.

His most recent novel, DARK WHISPERS, is the third book in his beloved Unicorn Chronicles series. He lives in Syracuse, New York, with his wife, Katherine.The third book in the Unicorn Chronicles is easier to understand if one is familiar with the background of the earlier books. Two plots are woven together. Cara Diana Hunter is on a quest for a critical story, and her father is on a journey in search of his wife. Transitions between the two tales are signaled by musical interludes that are helpful in keeping the listener grounded. The cast is strong, with a wide range of voices. At times, Cara and her little companion, the Squijim, are jarringly loud and shrillas if to emphasize the tension of the plot. For the most part, however, the performers allow the story to create the mood and provide dimension to their characters.

Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH is a monumental study of the 20th Century's most frightening moments. Now, 53 years after the end of World War II, it may seem incredible that our most valued institutions, and way of life, were threatened by the menace that Hitler and the Third Reich represented. Shirer's description of events and the cast of characters who played such pivotal roles in defining the course Europe was to take is unforgettable.<br><br>Benefiting from his many years as a reporter, and thus a personal observer of the rise of Nazi Germany, and availing himself of some of the 485 tons of documents from the German Foreign Office, captured by the First Army, as well as countless other diaries, phone transcriptions, and other written records, meticulously kept at every level by the Germans, Shirer has put together a brutally objective account of how Hitler wrested political control of Germany, and planned and executed his 6 year quest to dominate the world, only at the end, to see Germany go down in flames.<br><br>The combination of personal recollection and amassing of historical evidence distinguishes this book as one of the great historical works of any time. For instance, he recounts that, from his apartment in Plosslgasse, in Vienna, he personally witnessed how perhaps half of Vienna's 180,000 Jews bargained their way to freedom in 1938.<br><br>Shirer explains that Hitler believed that France and England were too weak to pose much of a threat to his ambitions to subjugate Czechoslovakia, and later Poland. The momentary relief of Russia as a threat to his domination of Europe as a result of the flurry of diplomatic activity that proceeded his invasion of Poland is fascinating. There is no relief, throughout his narrative, of the brutality of Hitler and such a large contingent of Germans who populate this narrative.<br><br>Although 1600 pages long, this is such a richly rewarding experience for anyone who wants to come to grips with the mysterious question as to how this menace to civilization ever came into being, much less was sustained for as long as it was. The answer, unfortunately, is that most of Germany, for a whole host of reasons, embraced Nazism and the fanaticism that Hitler engendered.<br><br>For another book that deals with this problem, why so much of Germany lent its support to Hitler, I heartily recommend HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONER'S, by Daniel Goldhagen, published by Vintage Books. Although filled with perhaps more statistical details then the non-professional historian would need, this book helps to adumbrate the themes in Shirer's great book.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group<b>Ron Rosenbaum </b>is the bestselling author of <i>Explaining Hitler </i>and <i>The Shakespeare Wars </i>and has written or edited six<i> </i>other books.

She taught creative writing at many universities, finally settling at SUNY Binghamton. She lives in Vermont.The much-lauded octogenarian Stone keeps up her appealing, sadder-but-wiser lyricism as she surveys subjects from McCormick reapers to radio astronomy, from fractals to "folded wings" and the fatigue of age, in this eighth collection, her first since the National Book Critics Circle Award winner Ordinary Words (1999). Stone veers easily between compressed stories of her Virginia upbringing and her own life, on the one hand, and scenic Americana on the other, finding material in "New York mountain weather," roaming cats, "the railroad's edge of metal trash." A third sort of Stone poem begins and ends in abstraction, finding spare lines for dejection or reflection, or asking, simply, "How can I live like this?" Stone's lifetime of craft permits her to pare down both description and meditation, and, at her best, make startling use of short, slow lines and of occasional rhyme; standout lyric work like "Train Ride" or "At Eighty-Three She Lives Alone" recalls at once Stanley Kunitz and Kay Ryan, and should find a place in many anthologies. Stone's lesser poems can digress into mere jottings; she tends to top off her terse scenes and speculations with forceful (sometimes forced) closing statements, what she calls "severe abstract designs." Even those poems, however, reflect an observant and contemplative life, focused on simplicities of feeling, yet possessed of unfolding subtleties.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Marking Time (Cazalet Chronicle)</h2><p>The wonderful sequel to The Light Years returns readers to Britain in September, 1939, as war breaks out. Sheltered Louise, now 16, goes from cooking school to London parties. For 14-year-old Polly, the terrors of war cannot forestall the pangs of adolescence. And though Clary&#39;s father has been reported missing since Dunkirk, she holds to the belief that he&#39;s alive.</p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard (1923 2014) was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles &#34;The Light Years&#34;, &#34;Marking Time&#34;, &#34;Confusion&#34;, &#34;Casting Off&#34;, and &#34;All Change&#34; have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and most recently for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 she was appointed commander to the Order of the British Empire.A perfect if inauspicious title for this second course of Howard's Cazalet Chronicles (begun with The Light Years, 1990), since this latest is all idling before something big happens--as the Cazalet writer-to-be, Clary, puts it, ``We need people to be in love with....We'll just have to wait.'' The waiting begins right after Chamberlain's ``peace with honor'' falls through and Hitler marches into Poland. At the Sussex manse of ``Brig'' Cazalet--now a blind old duffer shepherded around by his faithful spinster daughter, Rachel--the much extended Cazalet family gathers with their gas masks, not to mention orphaned babies (one of Rachel's charity), wounded soldiers, and London evacuees. The Brig's eldest son, Hugh, lamed during the Great War, stays at home to blunder along with the family timber firm and to coddle his wife, Sybil, who has incurable cancer; middle son, Edward, the womanizer, joins up, spending weekend leaves sexually abusing his beautifully budding daughter, Louise, while his wife, Villy, develops a crush on a conductor; and the last son, Rupert, goes missing in action right before his young wife, Zoe, has a baby. In addition, Howard focuses on the children of this crew, including: 17-year-old Louise, who attends acting school; Clary, Rupert's daughter by his late first wife, who nicely copes with her airheaded stepmother and fills her journal feverishly; and Polly, whose chief attribute is her goodness. By the end, Japan has drawn the US into the war; there's word of Rupert, possible romance for Clary, and as always, the Cazalets marching ever on.

She identifies the female nature of Christ&#39;s suffering and the motherhood of God, using images from domestic daily life, emphasizing the homeliness of God&#39;s love. She writes in a lively and unpretentious manner and her theology is precise without ever being pedantic.</p><p>"I have been reading Lady Julian of Norwich," declares C.S. Lewis in a letter to his former pupil, the Benedictine mystic Bede Griffiths. "A dangerous book, clearly. I'm glad I didn't read it much earlier." Thomas Merton wrote simply, "There can be no doubt that Julian is the greatest of the English mystics."<p></p><p>Few texts have had held such interest or been the object of such enduring devotion as has Julian of Norwich's 14th-century classic <i>A Revelation of Love</i>. This great work--along with <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> and Teresa of Avila's <i>The Interior Castle</i>--form the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul's quest for the divine. This new translation of Julian's mystical writings offers today's reader immediate access to this most powerful spiritual of books written in English. Julian's message of God's intimate and enabling love is revealed as both beguiling and inescapable. The poetry and rhythmic structure of the original Middle English text are respected, yet it is given fresh immediacy since it is now rendered in inclusive language for the first time ever. Moreover Julian's key ideas are easily identified-even by newcomers to her unique system of thought-by means of an original and authoritative linking commentary at the head of each key chapter, as well as continuing support from highly informative footnotes and a detailed glossary of the main terms used.</p>Julian of Norwich&#39;s fourteenth-century classic, A Revelation of Love - along with The Cloud of Unknowing and Teresa of Avila&#39;s The Interior Castle - forms the very heart of Western mysticism, and each generation has cherished its beautiful poetry and profound account of a soul&#39;s quest for the divine.

The three masts and their stripped minimal shapes of battle-sail towered above her, and the other five frigates of the Montivallan Navy squadron traced a line behind her that might have been drawn with a ruler, white wakes against the cerulean blue of the ocean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A little farther out from shore were the smaller, less drilled ships of the allied fleets, the navies of Hawai'i and Dai-Nippon, and the transports and barges that bore the troops who would storm ashore to put right the sneak attack and invasion. It was the task of the warships to soften their way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bolts and eighteen-pound roundshot arched out, a near-flicker as they left the launching troughs, arching away into invisibility with distance. That drew a merciful veil over what would be happening on shore as they slashed into the massed ranks of the Korean invasion forces, the dense black mass on the white beach, sparkling here and there with edged metal. They raised their square shields in a futile gesture against missiles designed to shatter the thick timber frames of warships or the stone of fortress walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>What was it Da said?</i> �rlaith thought grimly. <i>Yes, that it's a great pity that</i> fighting evil <i>starts with killing evil's conscripted farmers.</i></p><p><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Odors of tarred rope and wood, hot canvas and sweat and metal oiled with canola gone slightly rancid in the mild warmth overwhelmed the scented breeze off the land, that itself was tainted with the smoke of burning homesteads where the invaders from the east had harried among the Hawaiian workshops and settlements around Pearl Harbor. Behind the Montivallan ships some smoke still rose from the ocean itself, where the enemy fleet had met its fate five days ago and was now mainly drifting wreckage . . . and bloated bodies feeding the gulls. Sweat ran down&nbsp; �rlaith's flanks into the padded arming jacket and trews beneath her suit of plate, light and flexible though that titanium-alloy marvel of smithcraft was, but this wasn't nearly as bad as some desert summers she'd worn it through back home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, when she took a dipper of water from the scuttlebutt with a murmur of thanks to the sailor, it slid down like the pure product of a mountain spring, stale and warm and tanged with the chemicals that kept it safe as it was. You had to be careful about things like that, though: it occurred to her that if she made a casual joke and asked if there wasn't cold beer instead, some officious twit might run around in a panic trying to find <i>actual </i>cold beer and getting in everyone's way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While she was off looking for the Grasscutter Sword with Reiko-and dodging the people her mother the High Queen had sent to drag her back if they could-she'd gotten used to being around only her core of followers who knew her well and were friends as well as vassals. It was irritating to readjust to people who saw only the rank, though she couldn't really blame them, since that was all they could know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Time to get closer," Admiral Naysmith commanded quietly, standing at ease in her white linen tropical-service uniform jacket and gold-braided epaulettes and fore-and-aft cocked hat. "Apparently they use all their artillery as dual-purpose, and they didn't have time to dismount any from their fleet. Which they didn't expect to lose, of course. Unwise to be so specialized."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Empress Reiko of Dai-Nippon spoke . . . in her own language, though her originally indescribable and purely book-learned English was reasonably understandable now after most of a year of dogged effort:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The <i>jinnikukaburi</i> navy is built for landing raiding troops and taking them off again. Fighting at sea is secondary for them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�rlaith translated, since she had perfect modern Nihonjin courtesy of the Sword of the Lady she bore, though she tactfully gave post-Change coinage of <i>jinnikukaburi</i> as the enemy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The literal rendering was something on the order of human-flesh cockroach or possibly cannibal bug monsters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Considering what her folk's scant survivors had suffered since the Change from the reavers who came across the Sea of Japan, Reiko's attitude was understandable, and she had a mild case compared to most of her countrymen. Particularly since the enemy <i>did</i> eat the flesh of those they killed . . . and one another, when they were really hungry or someone was being punished. They didn't always kill you first, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Montival wanted to keep it plain they were fighting Korea's demon-ridden sorcerer tyrants, not the land or the people, however much they'd been corrupted by that tyranny and however theoretical the distinction most of the time. Distance made that easier. Reiko had admitted the usefulness of the distinction, but rather grudgingly; most of her subjects simply wanted to kill them all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Naysmith gave a respectful salute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty, that explains a good deal," she said to Reiko, and added: "<i>Domo arigato</i>," with a pronunciation �rlaith's ear caught as just as bad as Reiko's English had been when they first met.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then the Royal Navy commander went back to watching the beach through a leveled telescope, her square blocky face calm beneath the small blue brand-scar of the Bearkiller A-List between her brows. Only the observers in the tops or held aloft by great man-bearing kites cabled to the sterns of the repeater frigates had a better view. If the enemy troops pulled back from the beach the allied assault could come ashore uncontested beneath its shelter . . . but if they didn't, they had to stand under the hammer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As �rlaith's mother had said to her once, battle was always a set of choices, and the mark of a really good commander was to present the other side with a series of choices that all amounted to: <i>damned if you do, damned if you don't,</i> each set worse than the last until they ended up with no alternatives between <i>surrender</i> and <i>die.</i></p><p><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And Da had laughed and marked out some maneuvers he'd seen on the table with crusts and saltshakers and gravy boats and wineglasses and added:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>And never, never give them the gift of time to recover from a mistake.</i></p><p><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His finger had stirred the improvised markers; she remembered the big long-fingered hands vividly, the scars and nicks and battered look of them and the way the red-gold hairs stood out against the weathered tan and the thick swordsman's wrists that hardly dimpled in at all from the forearm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Looks easy here, does it not, my darling girl, here when we're cool and collected and can see it all? And you say, </i>How could this captain or that have blundered so? <i>But ah, when your heart is pounding and there's dust in your eyes and much depends on the next decision and everyone's screaming at you for this or that . . . then it's hard, hard. Any fool can hit, timing is much less common, so it is. The same punch can break your knuckles or his face, depending on when you throw it. And waiting because you can't decide . . . that's a decision too, and always a bad one.</i></p><p><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Naysmith went on: "Switch to napalm shell. Open up the fleet and tack in succession, conforming to <i>Sea-Leopard</i>. All ships keep full lookouts on each other. Minimal sail, dead slow, just enough to keep steerage way, prepare to strike sail and drop anchor on the word of command. Captain Edwards, you will take this ship in about another three hundred yards closer to shore for our next pass to establish the bombardment line."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Aye-aye, Admiral," he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd just made a vote of confidence in his ship-handling skills and those of the other frigate-captains, since it was the sort of maneuver that looked easy and stately . . . unless it ended in disaster. The local pilots their new ally King Kalakaua had supplied were a help, but the Montivallan frigates were also deeper-keeled than anything they were used to. And since there was no time to do their own surveys they'd just have to hope the charts were accurate, which so far they had been.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Then make it so."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Sea-Leopard</i>'s captain echoed the command, and signal flags relayed it to the rest of the allied fleet. The ship came about as the four hands at the helm spun the fore-and-aft paired wheels, the view past the distant bowsprit circling with ponderous certainty, land and then sea again as the third officer pointed with his cane and called:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thus . . . thus . . . very well, thus!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A volley of commands via speaking-trumpet ran upward as the sails were adjusted by the crew aloft, and deck-teams hauled away and cursed the men-at-arms of the Protector's Guard and the kilted ranks of the High Queen's Archers who crowded into their working-space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>�rlaith could look down from the quarterdeck through a hatchway and into a part of the ordered confusion of sweating backs heaving at the levers of the hydraulic pumps that cocked the massive springs of the throwing weapons. Now they rushed to the other broadside as if the shrill twittering of the bosun's pipe were playing directly on their nervous systems, adding to the slight canting of the deck.

Ellis focuses the conversation on the often-asked question "What would the Founding Fathers think?" He examines four of our most seminal historical figures through the prism of particular topics, using the perspective of the present to shed light on their views and, in turn, to make clear how their now centuries-old ideas illuminate the disturbing impasse of today's political conflicts. He discusses Jefferson and the issue of racism, Adams and the specter of economic inequality, Washington and American imperialism, Madison and the doctrine of original intent. Through these juxtapositions--and in his hallmark dramatic and compelling narrative voice--Ellis illuminates the obstacles and pitfalls paralyzing contemporary discussions of these fundamentally important issues.</p><p>JOSEPH J. ELLIS is the author of many works of American history including <i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and <i>American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson,</i> which won the National Book Award. He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts with his wife and is the father of three sons.<b>Preface</b><br><br>My Self-Evident Truth<br><br>"History is always unfinished in the sense that the future always uses its past in new ways."<br>- Peter Gay, <i>Style in History</i> (1974)<br>Self-evident truths are especially alluring because, by definition, no one needs to explain why they are true. The most famous example of this lovely paradox, which gave the term its name, is the second paragraph in the Declaration of Independence (i.e. &#x201c;We hold these truths to be self-evident&#x201d;), where Thomas Jefferson surreptitiously imbedded the creedal statement of the American promise.<br><br> The ironies abound, since Jefferson almost certainly did not know he was drafting the American Creed, and subsequent generations worshipped his words for reasons different than he intended. Moreover, his initial draft described the truths as &#x201c;sacred and undeniable,&#x201d; and it was probably Benjamin Franklin who suggested the change to &#x201c;self-evident.&#x201d; But, in the end, such nettlesome details have proven powerless against the sweeping influence of Jefferson&#x2019;s message, which defined the terms of the liberal tradition in American history.<br><br> My professional life as a writer and teacher of American history has been informed by another self-evident truth. As I try to put it into words, I worry that the very act of self-conscious articulation might drain away the unconscious magic of my working assumption and expose it as an illusion. But let me try. It goes like this: the study of history is an ongoing conversation between past and present from which we all have much to learn.<br><br> There, having said it, I can see that the formulation is helpfully vague. It does not dictate what we can learn, and therefore casts a wide net that gathers in a messy variety of both personal and public lessons. Most of my experience comes from forty-plus years of teaching in a liberal arts college, where there is less distance between students and faculty. In such schools communication does not end with graduation, but lives on in a feed-back loop about the relevance and irrelevance of what had been learned years ago.<br><br> The dominant pattern was a random and wholly unpredictable kind of relevance. There was the Chinese student who had done a research paper for me on the Massachusetts Constitution, which was drafted singlehandedly by John Adams. This served as the inspiration, so she claimed, for her work back in Shanghai, writing a putative constitution for post-communist China. At her twenty-fifth reunion another student told me that her career as a corporate executive had been influenced by two lectures on the Civil War, one from the northern, the other from the southern perspective, which helped her to think ironically. Several former students, both women and men, reported that their efforts to negotiate the inescapable tension between career and family were informed by their reading of Abigail Adams&#x2019;s letters, citing most especially her indomitable resilience.<br><br> Such examples suggest that I was not completely fooling myself in believing that history has something to teach us all, even though it was impossible to know at the moment of learning just what that something might be. Self-conscious attempts to teach or preach relevance in history are therefore unnecessary, because the connection between then and now is imbedded in the enterprise, fated to emerge in the future in unforeseeable ways. In that sense, reading history is like expanding your memory further back in time, and the more history you learn, the larger the memory bank you can draw on when life takes a turn for which you are otherwise unprepared.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> Obviously, a few reassuring testimonials from former students do not a compelling case make. But since my belief in history&#x2019;s utility was an unquestioned article of faith, it did not require overwhelming evidence, only sufficient support to sustain its credibility. And on that score the historical record provided several dramatic illustrations of a usable past that caught my eye. My two favorite examples featured John Adams during the American Revolution and Abraham Lincoln on the issue of slavery.<br><br> In June of 1776 Adams wrote to several friends in Boston, asking them to scour the Harvard library for books on military history, especially accounts of the Peloponnesian and Punic wars. He had just been appointed head of the Board of War and Ordnance, effectively making him secretary of war, a post for which he freely admitted he was wholly unprepared. He decided to give himself a crash course on how to manage an army.<br><br> Over the ensuing months he bombarded George Washington and the general officers of the Continental Army with advice gleaned from his reading. His most relevant strategic suggestion, which was based on his analysis of the battles between Thebes and Sparta as recorded by Thucydides, was to adopt a defensive strategy, what he called &#x201c;a war of posts.&#x201d; Much like the Spartans, Adams argued, the British were virtually invincible on a conventional battlefield, so the Continental Army should engage only when it enjoyed tactical superiority in numbers or terrain. Such advice cut against all of Washington&#x2019;s aggressive instincts, but he eventually, if reluctantly, embraced it. The result was a protracted war that the British had to win, while the Americans had only not to lose. This proved a more attainable goal, eventually achieved when the British abandoned the conflict after the battle of Yorktown in 1781.<br><br> In 1858 Abraham Lincoln also began a research project, in his case focused on the records of the Constitutional Convention and the early histories of that seminal event. Lincoln&#x2019;s research was prompted by the landmark Supreme Court decision, <i>Dred Scott</i> v <i>Sanford</i> (1857), in which Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing for the majority, ruled that the framers of the Constitution regarded slaves as property rather than persons, meaning that slave-owners could not be deprived of their property without their consent, which led to the conclusion that any law prohibiting slavery in the western territories was unconstitutional.<br><br> Lincoln&#x2019;s reading of history led him to a dramatically different conclusion, namely that many of the founders sought to limit slavery&#x2019;s expansion, a view which he presented in its fullest form in his Cooper Union Address (1860). He discovered that twenty-one of the thirty-nine signers of the Constitution were on record for banning or restricting slavery in the territories. Both Washington and Jefferson, as well as sixteen signers, endorsed the Northwest Ordinance, which prohibited slavery north of the Ohio River. Jefferson had even wanted to ban slavery in<i> all</i> the new territories.<br><br> As for the larger question of slavery itself, Lincoln argued that the founding generation regarded it as a moral embarrassment that clearly defied the principles announced in the Declaration of Independence, which was the major reason the delegates in Philadelphia refused to permit the toxic term to contaminate the language of the Constitution. As Lincoln described them, the founders thought of slavery as a cancer they could not surgically remove without killing the infant American republic in the cradle. Throughout the trials and tribulations of America&#x2019;s bloodiest war, Lincoln maintained he was acting as the agent of the founding generation, so that the Union cause spoke for the true meaning of the American Revolution.<br><br> It is worth noting that both Adams and Lincoln went back to the past with explicit political agendas, which is to say that they knew what they were looking for. So, for that matter, did Chief Justice Tanney, who harbored a proslavery agenda. By definition, all efforts to harvest the accumulated wisdom of the past must begin from a location in the present, so the questions posed of the past are inevitably shaped either consciously or unconsciously by the historical context in which they are asked. Unlike my former students, who discovered relevant historical insights later in life, almost accidentally, the Adams and Lincoln examples were self-conscious attempts to generate historical evidence in support of preferred outcomes. When it comes to the writing of relevant history, there are no immaculate conceptions.<br><br> This is an inconvenient truth that most historians acknowledge under their breath, admitting that objectivity, in the sense that mathematicians or physicists use the term, is not a realistic goal for historians. The best they can strive for is some measure of detachment, which serves the useful purpose of stigmatizing the most flagrant forms of ideological prejudice (i.e. cherry picking the evidence to claim that Thomas Jefferson was an evangelical Christian or Andrew Jackson a New Deal Democrat.) But if you believe that the study of history is an ongoing conversation between past and present, detachment itself is delusional. In his <i>Style in History</i> (1974) Peter Gay put the point succinctly: &#x201c;History is always unfinished in the sense that the future always uses the past in new ways.&#x201d; In fact, the past is not history, but a much vaster region of the dead, gone, unknowable or forgotten. History is what we choose to remember, and we have no alternative but to do our choosing now.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> My goal in the pages that follow is to provide a round-trip ticket to the late eighteenth century, then back to our location in the second decade of the twenty-first. The founding era has been chosen as a destination for two reasons: first, of all of the terrain in American history, I know it best; second, it produced the Big Bang that created all the planets and orbits in our political universe, thereby establishing the institutional framework for what is still an ongoing argument about our destiny as a people and a nation. Thus my title.<br><br> The questions we will be carrying back to the founding from our sliver of time in the present are inescapably shaped by our location in a divided America that is currently incapable of sustained argument and unsure of its destiny. We inhabit a backlash moment in American history of uncertain duration. Our creedal convictions as Americans, all of which have their origin in the founding era, are bumping up against four unforeseen and unprecedented obstacles: the emergence of a truly multiracial society; the inherent inequalities of a globalized economy; the sclerotic blockages of an aging political architecture; and the impossible obligations facing any world power once the moral certainties provided by the Cold War vanished. These obstacles became more difficult to negotiate in 2016, when the most inexperienced, uninformed, and divisive presidential candidate in American history occupied the Oval Office.<br><br> The <i>Now</i> sections of the ensuing chapters represent my effort to place each of these topical areas&#x2014;race, income inequality, jurisprudence, and foreign policy&#x2014;in historical context by viewing them as recent entries in longstanding patterns. The <i>Then</i> sections focus on specific founders, chosen in part because of their prominence, but mostly because, based on my previous work in their papers, each founder speaks with special resonance to the subject under scrutiny. Much in the way the founders went back to the Greek and Roman classics for guidance during the political crisis of their time, we are going back to the founders, our classics, in ours.<br><br> Our goal, then, is to learn more about our origins in the fond hope that doing so will allow us to frame the salient questions of our own time with greater wisdom than we are currently able to muster on our own. Moreover, the very act of posing such questions also enhances the prospects of viewing the founders themselves from new angles that cast their legacy in a different light. We can safely assume that the dialogue between now and then is an interactive process possessing the potential to change both sides of the chronological equation.<br><br> Although the founders are busy being dead, they still speak to use in the vast archive of letters and documents they left behind. The historical record is so rich because the revolutionary generation realized that they were &#x201c;present at the creation&#x201d; and therefore preserved their thoughts in the belief that posterity would want to remember them. Over the years, a small army of editors has worked assiduously on that preservation project, producing the fullest account of any political elite in recorded history. My attempt to recover the American Dialogue is wholly dependent on that documentary record.<br><br> Of course, the suggestion that there is an ongoing conversation across the centuries is a literary conceit, but we pay homage to the dialogue every time we cite the seminal texts of the founding to fortify our current convictions. As a lovely song once put it, the fundamental things apply, as time goes by.<br><br> In the pages that follow I will try to do justice to both sides of the dialogue. What did &#x201c;all men are created equal&#x201d; mean then and now? Did the &#x201c;pursuit of happiness&#x201d; imply the right to some semblance of economic equality? Does it now? Who were included in &#x201c;We the people&#x201d; then? Who is included now? Is it historically correct to describe the United States as an &#x201c;exceptional&#x201d; nation? If so, what are its current implications? Did the founders leave a legacy of government as &#x201c;us&#x201d; or &#x201c;them&#x201d;? If the correct answer is both, which legacy best meets our needs now?<br><br> Given our current condition as a deeply divided people, my hope is that the founding era can become a safe place to gather together, not so much to find answers to those questions as to argue about them. Indeed, if I read the founders right, their greatest legacy is the recognition that argument itself is the answer.</p><h2>What&#39;s Wrong With Your Life Insurance</h2><p>A completely revised and expanded edition of the controversial bestseller that for more than 25 years has alerted hundreds of thousands of Americans to the abuses of the life insurance industry.</p><p>A standard "cash value" life insurance policy will pay its prescribed death benefit in any year the prescribed premium is paid up, and the premium usually is reduced eventually to zero by an ever-increasing annual "dividend." Nevertheless, in this updated version of a controversial 1963 title, Dacey ( How to Avoid Probate! ) denounces the insurance industry as a whole for misusing policyholders' money. Huge surpluses from lapsed policies, investments and favorable mortality experience, argues the author, finance exorbitant executive salaries and agent compensation. He sees deception everywhere in the modern insurance world of policies combining mortality charges with a savings/investment program. The variety of such formulas is almost infinite, their complexity confusing to the prospect they are meant to fool (and to the reader), as Dacey demonstrates exhaustively. His uncomplicated advice: "Buy cheaper term-insurance and invest the difference." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Just about everything is wrong with your life insurance, according to Dacey, unless you have simple term insurance. In this scathing update of his 1963 book of the same name, Dacey, also author of How To Avoid Probate (1965), catalogs the numerous abuses and deceptions he sees being foisted upon an unsuspecting public. Dacey has an inflammatory style ("avaricious industry" and "financial Moloch" are representative epithets), but amply demonstrates, largely from the industry's own sources, how agents strive to sell high-commission cash value policies that leave customers under-insured. His advice: Buy term and invest the difference. While this is a valuable source, it has an enormous amount of detail and is far too repetitious. Careful editing would have made it leaner, if not meaner.

Though it was June, and she knew the sun was shining on the streets of Paris sixty feet above her, Dr. Maura Isles felt chilled as she walked down the dim passageway, its walls lined almost to the ceiling with human remains. She was familiar, even intimate, with death, and had confronted its face countless times on her autopsy table, but she was stunned by the scale of this display, by the sheer number of bones stored in this network of tunnels beneath the City of Light. The one-kilometer tour took her through only a small section of the catacombs. Off-limits to tourists were numerous side tunnels and bone-filled chambers, their dark mouths gaping seductively behind locked gates. Here were the remains of six million Parisians who had once felt the sun on their faces, who had hungered and thirsted and loved, who had felt the beating of their own hearts in their chests, the rush of air in and out of their lungs. They could never have imagined that one day their bones would be unearthed from their cemetery resting places, and moved to this grim ossuary beneath the city.<br><br>That one day they would be on display, to be gawked at by hordes of tourists.<br><br>A century and a half ago, to make room for the steady influx of dead into Paris's overcrowded cemeteries, the bones had been disinterred and moved into the vast honeycomb of ancient limestone quarries that lay deep beneath the city. The workmen who'd transferred the bones had not carelessly tossed them into piles, but had performed their macabre task with flair, meticulously stacking them to form whimsical designs. Like fussy stonemasons, they had built high walls decorated with alternating layers of skulls and long bones, turning decay into an artistic statement. And they had hung plaques engraved with grim quotations, reminders to all who walked these passageways that Death spares no one.<br><br>One of the plaques caught Maura's eye, and she paused among the flow of tourists to read it. As she struggled to translate the words using her shaky high school French, she heard the incongruous sound of children's laughter echoing in the dim corridors, and the twang of a man's Texas accent as he muttered to his wife. "Can you believe this place, Sherry? Gives me the goddamn creeps . . ."<br><br>&nbsp;The Texas couple moved on, their voices fading into silence. For a moment Maura was alone in the chamber, breathing in the dust of the centuries. Under the dim glow of the tunnel light, mold had flourished on a cluster of skulls, coating them in a greenish cast. A single bullet hole gaped in the forehead of one skull, like a third eye.<br><br>I know how you died.<br><br>The chill of the tunnel had seeped into her own bones. But she did not move, determined to translate that plaque, to quell her horror by engaging in a useless intellectual puzzle. Come on, Maura. Three years of high school French, and you can't figure this out? It was a personal challenge now, all thoughts of mortality temporarily held at bay. Then the words took on meaning, and she felt her blood go cold . . .<br><br>Happy is he who is forever faced with the hour of his death<br><br>&nbsp;And prepares himself for the end every day.<br><br>&nbsp;Suddenly she noticed the silence. No voices, no echoing footsteps. She turned and left that gloomy chamber. How had she fallen so far behind the other tourists? She was alone in this tunnel, alone with the dead. She thought about unexpected power outages, about wandering the wrong way in pitch darkness. She'd heard of Parisian workmen a century ago who had lost their way in the catacombs and died of starvation. Her pace quickened as she sought to catch up with the others, to rejoin the company of the living. She felt Death pressing in too closely in these tunnels. The skulls seemed to stare back at her with resentment, a chorus of six million berating her for her ghoulish curiosity.<br><br>&nbsp;We were once as alive as you are. Do you think you can escape the future you see here?<br><br>When at last she emerged from the catacombs and stepped into the sunshine on Rue Remy Dumoncel, she took in deep breaths of air. For once she welcomed the noise of traffic, the press of the crowd, as if she had just been granted a second chance at life. The colors seemed brighter, the faces friendlier. My last day in Paris, she thought, and only now do I really appreciate the beauty of this city. She had spent most of the past week trapped in meeting rooms, attending the International Conference of Forensic Pathology. There had been so little time for sightseeing, and even the tours arranged by the conference organizers had been related to death and illness: the medical museum, the old surgical theater.<br><br>The catacombs.<br><br>&nbsp;Of all the memories to bring back from Paris, how ironic that her most vivid one would be of human remains. That's not healthy, she thought as she sat at an outdoor caf�, savoring one last cup of espresso and a strawberry tart. In two days, I'll be back in my autopsy room, surrounded by stainless steel, shut off from sunlight. Breathing only the cold, filtered air flowing from the vents. This day will seem like a memory of paradise.<br><br>&nbsp;She took her time, recording those memories. The smell of coffee, the taste of buttery pastry. The natty businessmen with cell phones pressed to their ears, the intricate knots of the scarves fluttering around women's throats. She entertained the fantasy that surely danced in the head of every American who had ever visited Paris: What would it be like to miss my plane? To just linger here, in this caf�, in this glorious city, for the rest of my life?<br><br>&nbsp;But in the end, she rose from her table and hailed a taxi to the airport. In the end she walked away from the fantasy, from Paris, but only because she promised herself she would someday return. She just didn't know when.<br><br>&nbsp;Her flight home was delayed three hours. That's three hours I could have spent walking along the Seine, she thought as she sat disgruntled in Charles de Gaulle. Three hours I could have wandered the Marais or poked around in Les Halles. Instead she was trapped in an airport so crowded with travelers she could find no place to sit. By the time she finally boarded the Air France jet, she was tired and thoroughly cranky. One glass of wine with the in-flight meal was all it took for her to fall into a deep and dreamless sleep.<br><br>&nbsp;Only as the plane began its descent into Boston did she awaken. Her head ached, and the setting sun glared in her eyes. The headache intensified as she stood in baggage claim, watching suitcase after suitcase, none of them hers, slide down the ramp. It grew to a relentless pounding as she later waited in line to file a claim for her missing luggage. By the time she finally stepped into a taxi with only her carry-on bag, darkness had fallen, and she wanted nothing more than a hot bath and a hefty dose of Advil. She sank back in the taxi and once again drifted off to sleep.<br><br>&nbsp;The sudden braking of the vehicle awakened her.<br><br>&nbsp;"What's going on here?" she heard the driver say.<br><br>&nbsp;Stirring, she gazed through bleary eyes at flashing blue lights. It took a moment for her to register what she was looking at. Then she realized that they had turned onto the street where she lived, and she sat up, instantly alert, alarmed by what she saw. Four Brookline police cruisers were parked, their roof lights slicing through the darkness.<br><br>&nbsp;"Looks like some kind of emergency going on," the driver said. "This is your street, right?"<br><br>&nbsp;"And that's my house right down there. Middle of the block."<br><br>&nbsp;"Where all the police cars are? I don't think they're gonna let us through."<br><br>&nbsp;As if to confirm the taxi driver's words, a patrolman approached, waving at them to turn around.<br><br>&nbsp;The cabbie stuck his head out the window. "I got a passenger here I need to drop off. She lives on this street."<br><br>&nbsp;"Sorry, bud. This whole block's cordoned off."<br><br>&nbsp;Maura leaned forward and said to the driver, "Look, I'll just get out here." She handed him the fare, grabbed her carry-on bag, and stepped out of the taxi. Only moments before, she'd felt dull and groggy; now the warm June night itself seemed electric with tension. She started up the sidewalk, her sense of anxiety growing as she drew closer to the gathering of bystanders, as she saw all the official vehicles parked in front of her house. Had something happened to one of her neighbors? A host of terrible possibilities passed through her mind. Suicide. Homicide. She thought of Mr. Telushkin, the unmarried robotics engineer who lived next door. Hadn't he seemed particularly melancholy when she'd last seen him? She thought, too, of Lily and Susan, her neighbors on the other side, two lesbian attorneys whose gay rights activism made them high-profile targets. Then she spotted Lily and Susan standing at the edge of the crowd, both of them very much alive, and her concern flew back to Mr. Telushkin, whom she did not see among the onlookers.<br><br>&nbsp;Lily glanced sideways and saw Maura approaching. She did not wave but just stared at her, wordless, and gave Susan a sharp nudge. Susan turned to look at Maura, and her jaw dropped open. Now other neighbors were turning to stare as well, all their faces registering astonishment.<br><br>&nbsp;Why are they looking at me? Maura wondered. What have I done?<br><br>&nbsp;"Dr. Isles?" A Brookline patrolman stood gaping at her. "It is-it is you, isn't it?" he asked.<br><br>&nbsp;Well, that was a stupid question, she thought. "That's my house, there. What's going on, officer?"<br><br>&nbsp;The patrolman huffed out a sharp breath. "Um-I think you'd better come with me."<br><br>&nbsp;He took her by the arm and led her through the crowd. Her neighbors solemnly parted before her, as though making way for a condemned prisoner. Their silence was eerie; the only sound was the crackle of police radios. They reached a barrier of yellow police tape, strung between stakes, several of them pounded into Mr. Telushkin's front yard. He's proud of his lawn and he's not going to be happy about that, was her immediate and utterly inane thought. The patrolman lifted the tape and she ducked under it, crossing into what she now realized was a crime scene.<br><br>She knew it was a crime scene because she spotted a familiar figure standing at the center of it. Even from across the lawn, Maura could recognize homicide detective Jane Rizzoli. Now eight months pregnant, the petite Rizzoli looked like a ripe pear in a pantsuit. Her presence was yet another bewildering detail. What was a Boston detective doing here in Brookline, outside her usual jurisdiction? Rizzoli did not see Maura approaching; her gaze was fixed instead on a car parked at the curb in front of Mr. Telushkin's house. She was shaking her head, clearly upset, her dark curls springing out in their usual disarray.<br><br>&nbsp;It was Rizzoli's partner, Detective Barry Frost, who spotted Maura first. He glanced at her, glanced away, and then did a sudden double take, his pale face whipping back to stare at her. Wordlessly he tugged on his partner's arm.<br><br>&nbsp;Rizzoli went absolutely still, the strobelike flashes of blue cruiser lights illuminating her expression of disbelief. She began to walk, as though in a trance, toward Maura.<br><br>"Doc?" Rizzoli said softly. "Is that you?"<br><br>"Who else would it be? Why does everyone keep asking me that? Why do you all look at me as though I'm a ghost?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Because . . ." Rizzoli stopped. Gave a shake of her head, tossing unkempt curls. "Jesus. I thought for a minute you were a ghost."<br><br>&nbsp;"What?"<br><br>&nbsp;Rizzoli turned and called out: "Father Brophy?"<br><br>&nbsp;Maura had not seen the priest standing off by himself at the periphery. Now he emerged from the shadows, his collar a slash of white across his neck. His usually handsome face looked gaunt, his expression shell-shocked. Why is Daniel here? Priests were not usually called to crime scenes unless a victim's family requested counsel. Her neighbor Mr. Telushkin was not Catholic, but Jewish. He would have no reason to request a priest.<br><br>&nbsp;"Could you please take her into the house, Father?" Rizzoli said.<br><br>&nbsp;Maura asked: "Is anyone going to tell me what's going on?"<br><br>&nbsp;"Go inside, Doc. Please. We'll explain later."<br><br>&nbsp;Maura felt Brophy's arm slip around her waist, his firm grasp clearly communicating that this was not the time for her to resist. That she should simply obey the detective's request. She allowed him to guide her to her front door, and she registered the secret thrill of the close contact between them, the warmth of his body pressed against hers. She was so aware of him standing beside her that her hands were clumsy as she inserted the key into her front door. Though they had been friends for months, she had never before invited Daniel Brophy into her house, and her reaction to him now was a reminder of why she had so carefully maintained a distance between them. They stepped inside, into a living room where the lamps were already on, lit by automatic timers. She paused for a moment near the couch, uncertain of what to do next.<br><br>&nbsp;It was Father Brophy who took command.<br><br>&nbsp;"Sit down," he said, pointing her to the couch. "I'll get you something to drink."<br><br>&nbsp;"You're the guest in my house. I should be offering you the drink," she said.<br><br>&nbsp;"Not under the circumstances."<br><br>&nbsp;"I don't even know what the circumstances are."<br><br>&nbsp;"Detective Rizzoli will tell you." He left the room and came back with a glass of water-not exactly her beverage of choice at that moment, but then, it didn't seem appropriate to ask a priest to fetch the bottle of vodka. She sipped the water, feeling uneasy under his gaze. He sank into the chair across from her, watching her as though afraid she might vanish.<br><br>At last she heard Rizzoli and Frost come into the house, heard them murmuring in the foyer to a third person, a voice Maura didn't recognize. Secrets, she thought. Why is everyone keeping secrets from me? What don't they want me to know?<br><br>She looked up as the two detectives walked into the living room. With them was a man who introduced himself as Brookline Detective Eckert, a name she'd probably forget within five minutes. Her attention was completely focused on Rizzoli, with whom she had worked before. A woman she both liked and respected.</p><h2>Phantom Encounters (Mysteries of the Unknown)</h2><p>The editors of Time-Life Books have produced another exciting series: Mysteries of the Unknown.

Lovecraft, Jack London, Bram Stoker, Richard Matheson, and Jack Vance</p><p>Kaye's companion volume to his Masterpieces of Terror and the Supernatural pulls together nearly 60 works by some of the finest writers of the past century, including Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, H. P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury and Richard Matheson. There are some pleasant surprises, too: stories by Joyce Carol Oates, Willa Cather, Stephen Crane and Winston Churchill. Although few of the tales are truly terrifying, many of them do indeed qualify as "unknown." Kaye's eclectic gathering, organized under categories such as "Ghosts and Miscellaneous Nightmares," "The Beast Within," "Acts of God" and "Fiends and Creatures," includes Darrell Schweitzer's and Jason Van Hollander's "The Throwing Suit," a disturbing portrait of gnosticism, artistic impression and damage to the immortal soul; Theodore Sturgeon's "Bianca's Hands," a surreal tale of one man's obsession with a disturbed girl's hands; Emilia Pardo-Bazan's "The Pardon," a suspenseful rendering of a husband's feared revenge, and Jack Snow's "Midnight," a nightmarish account of the eternal hell on earth that an occultist visits upon himself. While readers may question the choice of certain works, bristle at Kaye's self-promotional references in several of the introductions and dismiss some of the older tales as dated, most horror fans will find ample enjoyment here.

In this wholly unique collection of essays, the two vocations meet as Lynch shows himself to be a competent functionary of mourning--dispensing comfort and homespun wisdom to the grief-stricken--as well as a poet poignantly tuning language to the right tones of private release. He is also a man of sardonic wit, uncovering humor where we least thought to find it--in our fear of and fascination with death. In its homages to parents who have died and to children who shouldn&#39;t have, its tales of golfers tripping over grave markers, portraits of gourmands and hypochondriacs, lovers and suicides, The Undertaking displays an impressively wide vocal range--from solemn, nostalgic, and lyrical to acerbic, sprightly, and unflinchingly professional.</p><p>"...I had come to know that the undertaking that my father did had less to do with what was done to the dead and more to do with what the living did about the fact of life that people died," Thomas Lynch muses in his preface to <i>The Undertaking</i>. The same could be said for Lynch's book: ostensibly about death and its attendant rituals, <i>The Undertaking</i> is in the end about life. In each case, he writes, it is the one that gives meaning to the other. A funeral director in Milford, Michigan, Lynch is that strangest of hyphenates, a poet-undertaker, but according to Lynch, all poets share his occupation, "looking for meaning and voices in life and love and death." Looking for meaning takes him to all sorts of unexpected places, both real and imagined. He embalms the body of his own father, celebrates the rebuilt bridge to his town's old cemetery, takes issue with the Jessica Mitfords of this world, and envisages a "golfatorium," a combination golf course and cemetery that could restore joy to the last rites. In "Crapper," Lynch even contemplates the subtleties of the modern flush toilet and its relationship to the messy business of dying: "Just about the time we were bringing the making of water and the movement of bowels into the house, we were pushing the birthing and marriage and sickness and dying out." Death and fatherhood, death and friendship, death and faith and love and poetry--these are the concerns that power Lynch's undertaking. Throughout, Lynch pleads the case for our dead--who are, after all, still living through us--with an eloquence marked by equal parts whimsy, wit, and compassion. In the last essay, "Tract," he envisions almost wistfully the funeral he'd choose for himself, and then relinquishes that, too. Funerals, after all, are for the living. The dead, he reminds us, don't care. <i>--Mary Park</i>Thomas Lynch&#39;s essays, poems and stories have appeared in The Atlantic, Granta, The New York Times, the New Yorker, the Paris Review, and elsewhere. He lives in Milford, Michigan where he has been the funeral director since 1974, and in Moveen, Co.

Charles Journet explores philosophy, revelation and history to explain grace fully.

He covers habitual grace, actual grace, predestination, justification, merit, and much more. He even includes a revealing exploration of Adam&#x2019;s earthly paradise and how the nature of the Fall called forth God&#x2019;s response of grace.</p><p></p><h2>Minding the store;: A memoir</h2><p>illustrated with photos</p><p></p><h2>Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 9 Volume 2: On Your Own</h2><p>With the Scooby gang on the skids, Buffy finds herself increasingly alone.

He has produced many movie soundtracks for Martin Scorsese and others, and continues to record as a solo artist. His most recent record, <i>How to Become Clairvoyant</i>, came out in 2011.One<br><br>Stared out that train window<br><br>into the darkness,<br><br>till I near went stone blind.<br><br>I patted out a rhythm on my knee and smiled to myself. Sounded like a song from the very place I was headed.<br><br>I was spellbound, gazing out the train window at silhouettes of passing towns, a blur of nocturnal landscapes streaming by. Only the lights were changing. Small-town shadows stirring quietly, city neon coloring the night sky, one scene blending into another. I&#x2019;d been awake for many hours, but I was too wound up to sleep, too nervous. No, too buzzed! Me and that train were headed to the holy land of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, to the fountainhead, where the music I loved grew right out of the ground. This was a southbound train.<br><br>Spring, 1960, sixteen years old. I was traveling from Toronto, Ontario, to Fayetteville, Arkansas, toward my chance to try out for a job playing with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks, the most wicked rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band around. Ronnie was a big rockabilly recording artist, an amazing showman with a fresh, Frankie Laine&#x2013;type voice. The Hawks were a powerhouse band with perfect casting: they looked as authentic as they sounded&#x2014;sideburns, slicked-back hair, Memphis cool, one part country gentlemen, three parts southern wild men.<br><br>I kept staring out that passenger-car window in wonderment. I&#x2019;d never been this far from home before. Every time the train whistle blew, a chill ran through me. I tried to close my eyes but couldn&#x2019;t sleep. This was all too new, too unimaginable, too dreamlike, because, it occurred to me, people from my background didn&#x2019;t hardly know how to dream.<br><br>I remember the exact day it all turned around for me. I had just stepped out the side door of St. Theresa&#x2019;s Catholic grade school when it hit me: a vicious combination of driving wind, burning ice needles to the face, and blinding snow. You couldn&#x2019;t see more than a few feet in front of you.<br><br>The public school lay between my school and my house, and it was plainly understood that you took your life in your hands with the kids who went there if you cut through that school yard. But in this storm I had to risk it. The sleet was pushing me to the ground every few steps. So I set myself on a direct line for enemy territory, hoping none of those tough older kids could possibly be out in this blizzard; I thought, Even Eskimos don&#x2019;t go out in this.<br><br>But then I spotted a figure in the distance. I was already halfway across the school yard, no turning around now. As I got closer, I saw that the guy was big, and he was coming toward me. My heart was pounding from wading through the snow and being pushed back by the wind, and now from fear. He stumbled toward me, shielding his face with his scarf, like a mask. Oh man, what does he want? But when I reached him he merely stuck out his hand, holding a paper flyer, and gestured for me to take it. I blinked. Then I took the paper, stuffed it in my pocket, and kept moving.<br><br>By the time I reached the side door of my house I looked like a zombie who had just crossed the Arctic Circle. My mother was there to greet me, saying, &#x201c;Goodness, get in here, you must be frozen!&#x201d; While hanging up my coat, she pulled the flyer out of my pocket and read it aloud. &#x201c; &#x2018;Music Lessons: Accordion, Violin, Spanish and Hawaiian guitar.&#x2019; Oh, are you interested in taking lessons?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook the snow from my hair. &#x201c;Sure, anything if it means I never have to walk through a blizzard like this again.&#x201d; I was already drawn to music and now wondered if maybe it could help me find a way out of this frozen hellscape. &#x201c;But not accordion,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;Lawrence Welk and all . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She laughed&#x2014;&#x201c;Okay, big dreamer&#x201d;&#x2014;and handed me a hot chocolate.<br><br>This was a turning point. I just didn&#x2019;t know it yet.<br><br>As the train idled at the Buffalo border crossing from Canada into the States, an immigration officer walking through the carriage asked me where I was going. It was a tricky moment: if I mentioned anything about a job, he&#x2019;d turn me back. I was trembling inside, but with a straight face I told him I was going to visit my brother and his family in Arkansas. He glanced at my birth certificate, then looked me dead in the eye. I just about swallowed my gum. After a pause he said, &#x201c;Have a good trip,&#x201d; and walked on.<br><br>As the train pulled away from the station and we crossed into the U.S., a wave of sadness came over me as I remembered what I&#x2019;d had to do to get the money to make my way south. Ronnie was looking to replace the guitarist or the bassist in his band, and he had told me, &#x201c;Come on down here and we&#x2019;ll see if it works out.&#x201d; This was my chance to convince him I was his man, so I thought it best not to ask him for any train money; nor did I want to bother my mother, who&#x2019;d given me a rough time about quitting school.<br><br>In the end there was only one thing to do: I had to sell my prized 1958 Fender Stratocaster with the original classic sunburst body. She was a real beauty. I&#x2019;d worked so hard to get her, saving up for months. But now I had to do whatever it took to get to Arkansas. I was on a mission but leaving that beloved Strat behind cut deep.<br><br>The first time I saw Ronnie and the Hawks perform, it was a revelation. I was only fifteen and Ronnie was playing the Dixie Arena in the west end of Toronto; the band I was in, the Suedes, was opening. We&#x2019;d been playing around Toronto for a few months, and opening for Ronnie Hawkins was the biggest thing we&#x2019;d ever done. After that night, I would look at music in a whole different light.<br><br>We had a strong lineup of players in our own group. Our drummer then was Pete &#x201c;the Bear&#x201d; De Remigis. He had a unique rolling-and-tumbling feel to his playing and hummed along unconsciously while he played, like a human kazoo. Pete Traynor, or &#x201c;Thumper,&#x201d; played bass. I&#x2019;d known him since I was thirteen, when we played together in the Rhythm Chords, the first band I ever hooked up with. We called him Thumper because of the way he manhandled the instrument. Pete would play and stare at you steadily, hardly ever looking at his hands. It made for a strange and powerful musical connection. Sometimes it got so intense I had to look away.<br><br>Scott &#x201c;Magoo&#x201d; Cushnie, our piano man, was twenty-one, and he had more musical training than the rest of us, as well as a sharp sense of humor and a fascinating inventory of slang words that he never shied from busting out. Some of them he invented and some could be attributed to his devotion to the popular, off-the-wall Bob and Ray radio show. I played lead guitar and sometimes sang, but for the Dixie Arena gig we had Johnny Rhythm on vocals. Johnny was part street hustler, part show-bar rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll impersonator, but the guy could sing like a bird. That night we played pretty good, and from the stage we could see Ronnie and his boys checking us out, which made us all reach a little higher. <br><br>But when the Hawk took the stage the whole atmosphere changed. The audience, which had been lingering around chatting, now crowded the front of the stage. Suddenly you could taste something raw and authentic in the air. The band was all dressed in black and red outfits. When they exploded into their first song, &#x201c;Wild Little Willie,&#x201d; the Hawk prowled the stage like a caged animal. He soared over Will &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; Jones&#x2019;s piano, growling a primitive war cry and miming a cranking motion behind Will&#x2019;s back like an organ-grinder winding up his monkey. Will was oblivious&#x2014;he was living inside the music, chewing gum to the rhythm, sweat flying, eyes crossed, head thrown back, hands pumping those ivories. Jimmy Ray &#x201c;Luke&#x201d; Paulman&#x2019;s Gretsch &#x201c;Country Gentleman&#x201d; guitar with its flat-wound strings poured on the rhythm. When Luke fired into a solo the Hawk had a chance to spin, flip, camel walk&#x2014;the original version of the moonwalk&#x2014;then tumble and land at Luke&#x2019;s feet. Toward the end of the solo, Ronnie would come back in singing like he was driving a mule train, and when he did the Hawks would settle into a slippery, swift locomotion behind his vocal.<br><br>Lefty Evans on bass was the only thing that kept the band grounded, or they might have become airborne and floated away. It was the most violent, dynamic, primitive rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll I had ever witnessed, and it was addictive.<br><br>In the center of it all was a young beam of light on drums. Teeth gleaming, laughing, bleached hair glowing, whole body shaking, drumsticks twirling, pushing those red sparkle drums with a hawk painted on the bass drum like a white tornado. It was the first time I saw Levon Helm, and I&#x2019;d never seen anything like it.<br><br>After the show I hung out while the Hawks packed up their guitars and drums, leaning in just to hear those southern accents, so rare up in Canada. I desperately wanted some of this mojo to rub off on me. They were playing at the club Le Coq d&#x2019;Or in Toronto for a couple more weeks, and I hung around them as much as I could without getting in the way, trying to make myself useful. Their road manager, Colin &#x201c;Boney&#x201d; McQueen, let me help out, doing stuff he didn&#x2019;t want to do, but I didn&#x2019;t care: this was biblical and I was fast becoming an apostle of the church of rockabilly.<br><br>One afternoon at the Warwick Hotel, where musicians, strippers, and small-time con men stayed in downtown Toronto, I overheard Ronnie say, &#x201c;Boys, I need some new songs. We&#x2019;re going in the studio next month.&#x201d;<br><br>A bell went off in my head. I had written some tunes for the little bands I&#x2019;d been in, but this could be a breakthrough. I ran home, grabbed my guitar, went to my room, and stayed up all night trying to write something that Ronnie could wrap his voice around&#x2014;hopefully something reminiscent of Gene Vincent&#x2019;s &#x201c;Woman Love.&#x201d;<br><br>By morning I had finished two songs. That day, I taught them to Johnny Rhythm, who could sing them in a style similar to Ron&#x2019;s, and soon we were playing them for the Hawk himself. He listened to both songs with a little smirk on his face, but when we finished he stood up and said, &#x201c;Play those again.&#x201d; Damned if they didn&#x2019;t sound better the second time around. Ron pointed a finger at me and declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to record both of them songs.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried not to get too excited in front of him, but inside I was overflowing. &#x201c;Not bad for a fifteen-year-old, right?&#x201d; I mumbled out of nervous joy. Ron just pointed his finger again and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be keeping an eye on you, boy. You might have some talent.&#x201d; When it came to finding good material this incredibly funny showman became stone serious, and it was fascinating to see him turn on a dime.<br><br>When Ronnie returned to Toronto a few months later, he brought his new album, Mr. Dynamo, and presented me with a sealed copy. &#x201c;Both your songs are on here, turned out pretty good.&#x201d; I tore open the LP and looked at the record label, thrilled to see their titles there&#x2014;&#x201c;Someone Like You&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hey Boba Lu.&#x201d; But when I looked for my name, I saw that the songwriting credit read, &#x201c;Robertson, Magil.&#x201d; Who was this &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; guy? What was this all about?<br><br>Ronnie laid it out for me: &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; was an alias used by a man named Morris Levy: the power behind Roulette Records, nightclub owner, business partner to the legendary rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll disc jockey Alan Freed, and mobster known for having a recording artist hung by the ankles out the window of his office building. &#x201c;See that Cadillac convertible parked down there?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;I can let go and drop you down into that car . . . or you can walk down there with the keys and drive away. All you have to do is sign the papers.&#x201d; When you recorded for Roulette, Morris Levy usually got a piece of the songwriting. &#x201c;Magil&#x201d; was his credit.<br><br>I started to protest but Ron said, &#x201c;Son, in this business there are certain things you don&#x2019;t even question. There are some ol&#x2019; boys in New York City you don&#x2019;t want to mess with.&#x201d; I had heard such stories of the ruthless rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll music business floating around, but I still couldn&#x2019;t help feeling like &#x201c;The Fool&#x201d; from the Sanford Clark song for not standing my ground.<br><br>A few days later, Ronnie came to me with an idea, one that would take me to New York City. If I could write songs for him, he said, maybe I also had an ear for other songs that would be good for him to record. Like many artists at that time, he didn&#x2019;t write much of his own music and was in constant search of new material. So with Levon doing most of the driving&#x2014;daytime, nighttime, it didn&#x2019;t matter to Levon&#x2014;we set off to New York. A friend of Ron&#x2019;s, Dallas Harms, who had written a couple of popular songs, came along. I felt as if I were part of an official song-search mission.<br><br>Crossing the bridge into Manhattan gave me chill bumps. I had never seen so many lights, so many movie theaters, so much neon, so many ladies of the night. I couldn&#x2019;t take it all in quick enough. We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street, and the next day Ronnie, with me in tow, hailed a cab. &#x201c;Is Levon coming?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, it&#x2019;s not his thing,&#x201d; Ronnie said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll play it better than anybody, but he ain&#x2019;t a song person, or he wouldn&#x2019;t still be singing &#x2018;Short Fat Fanny&#x2019; every night.&#x201d; Ron chuckled and slapped my knee as the taxi pulled away. &#x201c;Son, that&#x2019;s what I brought you for. We gotta find me some good material.&#x201d;<br><br>We headed for the Brill Building. With its high entranceway and gold doors, 1619 Broadway was like a temple for tunesmiths. It was the Tin Pan Alley of its day, just north of Times Square, the eleven-story heart of the music industry, a warren of small and large production offices humming with songwriters, musicians, music publishers, and producers. Inside, a guy from the record company took us around to the different music rooms making introductions: Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Otis Blackwell, and, oh yes, the outrageous singer-songwriter Titus Turner, who had just had his own hit on the King label with &#x201c;Return of Stagolee.&#x201d; They were all tickled by Ron&#x2019;s stories and cutups. &#x201c;Boys, I&#x2019;ll tell ya,&#x201d; he crowed, &#x201c;there ain&#x2019;t no difference between me and Elvis Presley except maybe looks and talent!&#x201d;</p><h2>Black Cat, Vol. 20</h2><p>R to L (Japanese Style)<br><br>Train Heartnet, also known as "Black Cat," was an infamous assassin for a secret organization called Chronos...until he abandoned that cold-blooded existence to live on his own terms as an easygoing bounty hunter.

The book's chronological but unusual format--it consists almost entirely of freestanding quotes, without transitional narration--works well. Sources include Graham's family, members of the Grateful Dead, Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and actor Peter Coyote; Graham, shrewd and outspoken, tells anecdotes of his own and never misses a chance to rebut his illustrious colleagues who reminisce here. His tale is the stuff of legends: a Jew born in Germany in 1931 and orphaned soon after, he was evacuated to France in 1939 and sent to the U.S. in 1941. He lived with a foster family in the Bronx, working as a waiter and cabbie until he found his calling as a rock impresario in 1960s San Francisco. Notoriety and controversy followed--for the next quarter century, he had a hand in everything from the Trips Festival to the Fillmore West to Woodstock to Live Aid to Amnesty International's Conspiracy of Hope tour.

As Gierach says, "The secret places are the soul of fishing." Hearing about a new one never fails to entice us. <p> And so <i>Where the Trout Are All as Long as Your Leg</i> transports the reader to the best of these places, where the fish are always bigger and the hatches last forever. After all, it's these magical places that Gierach so vividly evokes that remind us how precious -- and precarious -- are the unspoiled havens of the natural world.</p></p><p>"The secret places are the soul of fishing.... It may be a private spring creek with armed guards where there are huge browns and lots of them, or it may just be an unknown beaver pond where a handful of book trout have grown to a whopping eleven inches. In either case, it's a spot that, by the simple virtue of being left more or less alone, has reached is full potential."So begins this brilliant short book, in which half a dozen such places are featured. There is a pool made memorable because it is part of a risky childhood adventure; hidden local streams; sections of a wealthy ranch; secret stretches - full of rattlesnakes - and private ponds with trout as long as your leg. All are made magically vivid by Gierach's special prose - and all stand starkly against a more public natural world increasingly threatened with ecological disaster.

How is it, then, that contemporary intellectuals generally dismiss the great Author of Sin as a foolish illusion? To explain why Satan has vanished from modern minds, Delbanco first explores the premodern religious views of such determined witch hunters as Samuel Sewall and Cotton Mather, men deeply fearful of Satan and his wiles. Then he shows how, bit by bit, modern precepts and social patterns drove Satan from the consciousness of leading Americans, making irony, not faith, their preferred spiritual posture when confronting evil. Surprisingly, it was the generation who lived through the Civil War that most decisively closed the metaphysical doors on Satan. For the horror of that war defied interpretation within inherited religious doctrine. Yet even in today's world, millions of Americans still--like Sewall and Mather--do believe in Satan. What is more, Delbanco admits that in locking Satan out of their philosophies, secular thinkers have unintentionally sterilized the imagination and muffled the conscience. Indeed, some modern thinkers have created surrogate Satans for themselves by demonizing people who differ from them in politics or culture. Better, the author advises, to see in the world's evils a reflection of our own incompleteness and inadequacy. Thought-provoking reading for believers and nonbelievers alike. <i>Bryce Christensen</i></p><h2>What the Robin Knows: How Birds Reveal the Secrets of the Natural World</h2><p><p>Companion audio files are available at www.hmhbooks.com/whattherobinknows </p><p>A lifelong birder, tracker, and naturalist, Jon Young is guided in his work and teaching by three basic premises: the robin, junco, and other songbirds know everything important about their environment, be it backyard or forest; by tuning in to their vocalizations and behavior, we can acquire much of this wisdom for our own pleasure and benefit; and the birds' companion calls and warning alarms are just as important as their songs.<br>Birds are the sentries&#x2014;and our key to understanding the world beyond our front door.

That question is central to this penetrating study of political action and the prophetic function. Jacques Ellul's answer to that question, though based on events recorded in the Second Book of Kings, is immediately relevant to contemporary issues and to the church today. Emerging from these reflections is an eloquent testimony to the immense love of God, &#x201c;which not only creates and saves but which also in its incomprehensible humility wants to associate man with its work.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacques Ellul (1912&#x2013;&#x2019;1994), a French sociologist and lay theologian, was professor emeritus of law and of the history and sociology of institutions at the University of Bordeaux.

He lives in Rockford, Iowa, with his family.Fun with Nature is six nature handbooks in one. Each of the book's six sections--"Caterpillars, Bugs and Butterflies"; "Frogs, Toads and Turtles"; "Rabbits, Squirrels and Chipmunks"; "Snakes, Salamanders and Lizards"; "Tracks, Scats and Signs"; and "Trees, Leaves and Bark"--is like its own self-contained book. Although nothing is covered in great depth, the reader does not feel short-changed. The text, illustrations and easy-to-follow format of the first four sections teach us what each animal looks like, what it eats and where it can be found. The section focusing on tracks, droppings (scat) and signs is organized by habitat and includes information about a number of animals, each shown in the setting where it is most likely to be sighted. The book's final section, about trees, leaves and bark, is particularly striking. The stark layout highlights the illustrations and brings details to the forefront. Most notable are the drawings of bark. They show the texture so realistically that there almost appear to be actual pieces of bark pasted onto the page. The book has several blank pages at the end of each section, should your young explorer wish to make sketches or take notes. Some hands-on activities are also suggested. In addition, advice and special warnings that will enhance your outings are set off in boxes at the bottom of many pages. Contrary to the title, this volume is a bit too heavy to work well as a field guide on a hike, but it's a great resource for reading beforehand and for referring to on your return. Young naturalists will enjoy this book. <p><i>Joan Silberlicht Epstein</i></p></p><h2>Mr. Marshal&#39;s Flower Book</h2><p>A dazzling rendition of the seventeenth-century horticulturist?s famed watercolors.Alexander Marshal?s Florilegium, or flower book, is one of the most exquisite and fascinating historic works of botanical art. The only surviving compilation of flower watercolors from seventeenth-century England, it has been admired for centuries for its dazzling color and its incredible attention to the intricacies of a varied array of plant species. A highly skilled, although self-taught artist, Alexander Marshal was a horticulturist and famed entomologist who believed the cultivation of plants was essential to the study of the natural world. He created his masterpiece over a period of thirty years, and in the nineteenth century, Florilegium was presented to King George IV to be housed in the Royal Library, where it has been preserved ever since.

Although he has since developed a huge following in the field of "regression therapy" (in which clients are hypnotized in order to access previous lifetimes), Weiss has focused this latest book on the here and now. "Past lives are still a significant concept and value for me, but understanding and expressing love, joy, and inner peace in my everyday life have become more significant," Weiss explains.<p> Weiss, who is now an internationally sought-after lecturer, uses his teaching voice to address happiness and love in our current lifetimes. This is indeed a "how-to" book, packed with ambitious discussions on why we choose to "come back" to our current lives and the role of fate. He also devotes many chapters to spiritual self-help, showing readers why it's important to let go of anger, develop a loving spiritual family, and cultivate love and compassion.

Cutler&#39;s western perspective. Covering all key areas of human experience, they apply the principles of Tibetan Buddhism to everyday problems and reveal how one can find balance and complete spiritual and mental freedom.For many who wish to understand more about the Dalai Lama&#39;s approach to living, there has never been a book which brings his beliefs so vividly into the real world.</p><p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to sit down with the Dalai Lama and really press him about life's persistent questions? Why are so many people unhappy? How can I abjure loneliness? How can we reduce conflict? Is romantic love true love? Why do we suffer? How should we deal with unfairness and anger? How do <i>you</i> handle the death of a loved one? These are the conundrums that psychiatrist Howard Cutler poses to the Dalai Lama during an extended period of interviews in <i>The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living</i>.<p> At first, the Dalai Lama's answers seem simplistic, like a surface reading of Robert Fulghum: Ask yourself if you really need something; our enemies can be our teachers; compassion brings peace of mind. Cutler pushes: But some people <i>do</i> seem happy with lots of possessions; but "suffering is life" is so pessimistic; but going to extremes provides the zest in life; but what if I don't believe in karma? As the Dalai Lama's responses become more involved, a coherent philosophy takes shape. Cutler then develops the Dalai Lama's answers in the context of scientific studies and cases from his own practice, substantiating and elaborating on what he finds to be a revolutionary psychology. Like any art, the art of happiness requires study and practice--and the talent for it, the Dalai Lama assures us, is in our nature. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>The Dalai Lama is one of the world&#39;s great spiritual leaders. The recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and many other international awards, he receives constant and extensive media coverage. Howard C.

He has strong ties with the Tibetan community and was chosen by the Dalai Lama to present and interpret his ideas in this book for a wider non-Buddhist audience.</p><h2>By Truman Capote: Music for Chameleons</h2><p>NEW WRITINGS BY TRUMAN CAPOTE</p><p></p><h2>Mysteries of the Unexplained</h2><p>As guards and fellow inmates watch in amazement, a chained prisoner simply disappears - and is never seen again!

Thousands of women readers became fascinated with identifying their own inner goddesses and using these archetypes to guide themselves to greater self&#x2013;esteem, creativity, and happiness. </p><p> Bolen's radical idea was that just as women used to be unconscious of the powerful effects that cultural stereotypes had on them, they were also unconscious of powerful archetypal forces within them that influence what they do and how they feel, and which account for major differences among them. Bolen believes that an understanding of these inner patterns and their interrelationships offers reassuring, true&#x2013;to&#x2013;life alternatives that take women far beyond such restrictive dichotomies as masculine/feminine, mother/lover, careerist/housewife. And she demonstrates in this book how understanding them can provide the key to self&#x2013;knowledge and wholeness. </p><p> Dr. Bolen introduced these patterns in the guise of seven archetypal goddesses, or personality types, with whom all women could identify, from the autonomous Artemis and the cool Athena to the nurturing Demeter and the creative Aphrodite, and explains how to decide which to cultivate and which to overcome, and how to tap the power of these enduring archetypes to become a better "heroine" in one's own life story. </p><p> </p></p><p>I wrote <i>Goddesses in Everywoman</i> as a psychology of women, that has over the past fifteen years since I wrote it, become something of a classic. I've been told how useful it has been to facilitate discussions between mothers and daughters, sisters, and friends about their differences and similarities. It's helped men understand the significant women in their lives (something women who have given the book to husbands and lovers, with chapters or passages marked, hoped would happen). It's a book that has become a text in a very wide variety of courses from high school to graduate school, in mythology, psychology, women's studies, literature, creative writing, drama, and counseling, and had a major influence in women's spirituality. Its perspective and mine is Jungian, feminist, spiritual, clinical, right brain and left. <p>I wish that women readers would also read <i>Gods in Everyman</i>, for a complete understanding of themselves. I think that just about every woman who does so, will find an aspect of herself in a god-archetype, which completes her internal pantheon. For example, Hermes (Mercury) the messenger god, is a very significant archetype in me. I have the exploratory energy of Artemis, but it is Hermes that puts what I learn in words and makes the intuitive connections. </p><p>Besides <i>Gods in Everyman</i>, two of my other books are related. <i>Ring of Power</i> (a new edition will be published February 1999) based on Richard Wagner's operatic Ring Cycle, focuses on dysfunctional family relationships between these same archetypes (with different names). In Crossing to Avalon, I wrote about my pilgrimage to sacred sites and what I experienced of goddess spirituality. A "sequel" to <i>Goddesses in Everywoman</i> is in the works -- I am now writing <i>Goddesses in Older Women</i>.</p><p>Myths are fascinating stories that become even more intriguing when we realize that they can reveal intimate truths about ourselves and others. Jean Shinoda Bolen brings the Greek pantheon to life as our inner archetypes and applies the power of myth to our personal lives. Once we understand the natural progression from myth to archetype to personal psychology, and realize that positive gifts and negative tendencies are qualities associated with a particular goddess within, we gain powerful insights. </p><p>Depending on which goddess is more active within, one woman might be more committed to achieving professional success, while another more fulfilled as a wife and mother. Bolen teaches women how to decide which qualities to cultivate and which to overcome, and how to tap the power of these enduring archetypes to become a better heroine in their own life stories.</p></p><h2>Creating a World Without Poverty: Social Business and the Future of Capitalism</h2><p>In the last two decades, free markets have swept the globe, bringing with them enormous potential for positive change.

It has been immortalized in high culture (Shakespeare&#39;s Henry V) and low (the New York Post prints Henry&#39;s battle cry on its editorial page each Memorial Day).It is the classic underdog story in the history of warfare, and generations have wondered how the English-outnumbered by the French six to one-could have succeeded so bravely and brilliantly. Drawing upon a wide range of sources, eminent scholar Juliet Barker casts aside the legend and shows us that the truth behind Agincourt is just as exciting, just as fascinating, and far more significant. She paints a gripping narrative of the October 1415 clash between outnumbered English archers and heavily armored French knights.But she also takes us beyond the battlefield into palaces and common cottages to bring into vivid focus an entire medieval world in flux. Populated with chivalrous heroes, dastardly spies, and a ferocious and bold king, AGINCOURT is as earthshaking as its subject-and will confirm Juliet Barker&#39;s status as both a historian and a storyteller of the first rank.</p><p>AUTHORBIO: Juliet Barker is the distinguished biographer of Wordsworth and the Bront� sisters. She is also a noted medievalist and lives with her husband and two children in the South Pennines, England.<i>Starred Review.</i> Barker, a British biographer (<i>The Bront�s</i>) and accomplished medievalist, brings an excellent synergy of academic and literary skills to this study of the 1415 British campaign in France and the battle that was its climax, around which she elaborately reconstructs the conflict's antecedents. Henry V spent years preparing the ground: asserting initially shaky authority in England, exploiting domestic strife in France and isolating the disorganized kingdom from its traditional allies. During the campaign itself, a train of artillery manned by foreign gunners supplemented the men-at-arms and the longbowmen, who were the British army's real backbone. But the French were not the vainglorious incompetents of English legend and Shakespearean drama. Many in northern France made a brave effort, often putting aside personal and political differences to stand together at Agincourt, where they came closer to success than is generally realized. Barker shows that the battle hung by a thread: French numbers against English desperation, with courage a common virtue. She also illustrates how Agincourt was decisive&#x2014;not only for its consequences in France. An English defeat would have meant chaos, perhaps civil war. Destiny on both sides of the Channel turned on the outcome of St. Crispin's Day. <i>(June 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

How in the world (and why in the world) did he do it? In nine highly engaging and entertaining chapters, complete with over 200 illustrations and photos, author and Spam-fan Carolyn Wyman traces the unbelievable success story of this one-of-a-kind, all-American, all-pork product, including: Spam's place in history, its role during World War II, and how Spam saved the Russian army from starvation, the making (yes, the ingredients) and the selling of Spam, from 1937 to today, spamming the Globe: From Zimbabwe to Anguilla, stories of Spam overseas, the infamous Monty Python skit and Spam's other starring roles and cameos in television, movies, cartoons, and music, delectable recipes like Spam Fritters, Spamtastic Mincemeat Truffles, and the award-winning Spam Cheesecake, Cyber Spam: The best of Spam on the Internet, including poetry from the Spam Haiku Archive. A fascinating portrait of an icon in a can, Spam: A Biography will delight everyone from the culinarily curious and connoisseurs of kitsch to netheads and veterans-and of course, Spam's true fans: the millions of people who eat America's "Miracle Meat" for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. SPAM-tistics: (1)Spam is sold in over 45 countries around the world. (2)Over 100 million cans are consumed by 60 million Americans each year, averaging 2.8 cans per second (3)The Spam can is part of the Smithsonian Institution's permanent collection (4)Over 5 billion cans of Spam have been sold since 1937. (5)Hawaiians are the highest per capita Spam eaters-averaging 4 cans/year per person-followed closely by Alaska, Arkansas, Texas, and Alabama (6)Hormel-sponsored Best of Spam Recipe competitions are held each year at more than 75 state and regional fairs (7)Over 20,000 people attend the Spam Jam in Spamtown, USA, aka Austin, Minnesota, Hormel's headquarters.<br></p><p>The Cadillac of canned meat food products finally gets its due with <i>Spam: A Biography</i>. The book traces the meat's story from its distant Hormel ancestry through its history-changing 1937 birth, right up to the present day. Along the way we discover that its ingredients are not nearly so revolting as one might have been lead to think (merely pork shoulder, ham, salt, sugar, and delicious sodium nitrite) and that Spam received its pithy name from actor and friend of the Hormel family, Kenneth Daigneau. But this is no rosy-hued love letter to luncheon meats. Wyman tackles the tough issues of Hormel's labor problems during the 1980s and the visceral hatred many World War II GIs developed for Spam after finding it in meals for days on end. (Wyman also notes alternative wartime Spam uses, including skin conditioner, gun lubricant, and thickly-sliced playing cards.) In an invaluable service, readers are reassured as to the benign nature of the disturbing gelatin that surrounds Spam, and taught how to tell which batch they're eating by deciphering the markings on their cans. The author also tracks the history of Spam advertising and descends into the terrifying maelstrom of obsessive Spam fans. Of course, no book on Spam would be complete without recipes, and Wyman includes some truly chilling examples, including "SPAMtastic Mincemeat Truffles," "Fruit Cocktail-SPAM Buffet Party Loaf," and the absolutely ungodly "Lobster Thermidor aux Crevettes with a Mornay Sauce Garnished with Truffle P�t�, Brandy, and a Fried Egg on Top and Spam." <i>--Ali Davis</i>Carolyn Wyman, author of <i>I'm a Spam Fan</i> and <i>The Kitchen Sink Cookbook</i>, has been widely profiled in the media, including CNN, The Rosie O'Donnell Show, Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post, NPR, and the New York Times.

After surveying over 500 women, Carolyn Duff and Barbara Cohen found that the very attributes that give us advantages at work--caring, compassion, and cooperation--can cause these difficulties. The virtue of caring, for example, may set us up for problems evaluating coworkers, and inhibit us from seeking advancement for fear of alienating work friends. And our desire to cooperate may make it difficult to take charge and make decisions. <i>When Women Work Together</i> identifies the factors that both enhance and threaten good workplace relations between women.

That&#x2019;s what I said.&#x201d; His valet, Tom Byrd, face carefully averted, put the lid back on the pot. &#x201c;Was you to rub yourself with&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>stuff, you&#x2019;d be drawing flies in their hundreds, same as if you were summat&nbsp;that was dead.&nbsp;<i>Long</i>&nbsp;dead,&#x201d; he added, and muffled the pot in a napkin for&nbsp;additional protection.<br>&#x201c;Well, in justice,&#x201d; Grey said dubiously, &#x201c;I suppose the whale&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;long&nbsp;dead.&#x201d; He looked at the far wall of his office. There were a number of flies&nbsp;resting along the wainscoting, as usual, fat and black as currants against&nbsp;the white plaster. Sure enough, a couple of them had already risen into the&nbsp;air, circling lazily toward the pot of whale oil. &#x201c;Where did you get that&nbsp;stuff?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The owner of the Moor&#x2019;s Head keeps a keg of it; he burns it in his&nbsp;lamps&#x2014;cheaper&nbsp;nor even tallow candles, he says, let alone proper wax&nbsp;ones.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ah. I daresay.&#x201d; Given the usual smell of the Moor&#x2019;s Head on a busy&nbsp;night, nobody would notice the stink of whale oil above the symphony of&nbsp;other reeks.<br><br> &#x201c;Easier to come by on Jamaica than bear grease, I reckon,&#x201d; Tom remarked,&nbsp;picking up the pot. &#x201c;D&#x2019;you want me to try it with the mint, me&nbsp;lord? It&nbsp;<i>might</i>&nbsp;help,&#x201d; he added, with a dubious wrinkle of the nose.<br>Tom had automatically picked up the oily rag that lived on the corner&nbsp;of Grey&#x2019;s desk and, with a dexterous flick, snapped a fat fly out of the air&nbsp;and into oblivion.<br><br> &#x201c;Dead whale garnished with mint? That should cause my blood to be&nbsp;especially attractive to the more discriminating biting insects in Charles&nbsp;Town&#x2014;to&nbsp;say nothing of Canada.&#x201d; Jamaican flies were a nuisance but&nbsp;seldom carnivorous, and the sea breeze and muslin window screening kept&nbsp;most mosquitoes at bay. The swamps of coastal America, though . . . and&nbsp;the deep Canadian woods, his ultimate destination . . .<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Grey said reluctantly, scratching his neck at the mere thought of&nbsp;Canadian deer flies. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t attend Mr. Mullryne&#x2019;s celebration of his new plantation house basted in whale oil. Perhaps we can get bear grease in&nbsp;South Carolina. Meanwhile . . . sweet oil, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br> Tom shook his head decidedly.<br><br> &#x201c;No, me lord. Azeel says sweet oil draws spiders. They come and lick it&nbsp;off your skin whilst you&#x2019;re asleep.&#x201d;<br><br> Lord John and his valet shuddered simultaneously, recollecting last&nbsp;week&#x2019;s experience with a banana spider&#x2014;a&nbsp;creature with a leg span the size&nbsp;of a child&#x2019;s hand&#x2014;that&nbsp;had burst unexpectedly out of a ripe banana, followed&nbsp;by what appeared at the time to be several hundred small offspring,&nbsp;at a garden party given by Grey to mark his departure from the island and&nbsp;to welcome the Honorable Mr. Houghton Braythwaite, his successor as&nbsp;governor.<br><br> &#x201c;I thought he&#x2019;d have an apoplexy on the spot,&#x201d; Grey said, lips twitching.<br><br> &#x201c;Likely wishes he had.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey looked at Tom, Tom at Grey, and they burst into suffocated snorts&nbsp;of laughter at the memory of the Honorable Mr. Braythwaite&#x2019;s face on&nbsp;this occasion.<br><br> &#x201c;Come, come,&#x201d; Lord John said, getting himself under control. &#x201c;This&nbsp;will never do. Have you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> The rumble of a carriage coming up the gravel drive of King&#x2019;s House&nbsp;interrupted him.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, God, is that him now?&#x201d; Grey glanced guiltily round at the disarray&nbsp;of his office: A gaping half-packed&nbsp;portmanteau lolled in the corner,&nbsp;and the desk was strewn with scattered documents and the remnants of&nbsp;lunch, in no condition to be viewed by the man who would inherit it&nbsp;tomorrow. &#x201c;Run out and distract him, will you, Tom? Take him to the&nbsp;receiving room and pour rum into him. I&#x2019;ll come and fetch him as soon as&nbsp;I&#x2019;ve done . . . something . . . about this.&#x201d; He waved a hand at the debris,&nbsp;and Tom obligingly vanished.<br><br> Grey picked up the oiled rag and disposed of an unwary fly, then seized&nbsp;a plate scattered with bread crusts, blobs of custard, and fruit peelings and&nbsp;decanted this out of the window into the garden beneath. Thrusting the&nbsp;empty plate out of sight under the desk, he began hurriedly to gather papers&nbsp;into piles but was interrupted almost at once by the reappearance of&nbsp;Tom, looking excited.<br><br> &#x201c;Me lord! It&#x2019;s General Stanley!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Grey said blankly. His mind, occupied with the details of imminent&nbsp;escape, refused to deal with anything that might interfere with said&nbsp;escape, but &#x201c;Stanley&#x201d; did ring a distant, small bell.<br><br> &#x201c;Might be as he&#x2019;s your mother&#x2019;s husband, me lord?&#x201d; Tom said, with a&nbsp;becoming diffidence.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh . . . that General Stanley. Why didn&#x2019;t you say so?&#x201d; John hastily&nbsp;grabbed his coat from its hook and shrugged into it, brushing crumbs off&nbsp;his waistcoat as he did so. &#x201c;Show him in, by all means!&#x201d;<br><br> John in fact liked his mother&#x2019;s third husband&#x2014;she&nbsp;having been twice&nbsp;widowed when she acquired the general four years before&#x2014;though&nbsp;any&nbsp;military intrusion at this point was something to be regarded warily.<br><br> Wariness was, as usual, justified. The General Stanley who eventually&nbsp;appeared was not the bluff, jaunty, self-confident&nbsp;man last seen in his&nbsp;mother&#x2019;s company. This General Stanley was hobbling with a stick, his&nbsp;right foot bound up in an immense bandage, and his face gray with pain,&nbsp;effort . . . and profound anxiety.<br><br> &#x201c;General!&#x201d; John seized him by the arm before he could fall over and&nbsp;guided him to the nearest chair, hastily removing a pile of maps from it.&nbsp;&#x201c;Do sit down, please&#x2014;Tom,&nbsp;would you . . . ?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just here, me lord.&#x201d; Tom had dug Grey&#x2019;s flask out of the open traveling&nbsp;bag with commendable promptitude and now thrust it into General&nbsp;Stanley&#x2019;s hand.<br><br> The general accepted this without question and drank deeply.<br><br> &#x201c;Dear Lord,&#x201d; he said, setting the flask on his knee and breathing heavily. &#x201c;I thought I shouldn&#x2019;t make it from the landing.&#x201d; He took another&nbsp;drink, somewhat more slowly, eyes closed.<br><br> &#x201c;More brandy, Tom, if you please?&#x201d; Grey said, watching this. Tom gave&nbsp;the general an assessing look, not sure whether he might die before more&nbsp;brandy could be fetched, but decided to bet on the general&#x2019;s survival and&nbsp;disappeared in search of sustenance.<br><br> &#x201c;God.&#x201d; The general looked a good deal short of human but distinctly&nbsp;better than he had. He nodded thanks to John and handed back the empty&nbsp;flask with a trembling hand. &#x201c;The doctor says I mustn&#x2019;t drink wine&#x2014;apparently it&#x2019;s bad for the gout&#x2014;but&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t recall his mentioning brandy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; John said, glancing at the bandaged foot. &#x201c;Did he say anything&nbsp;about rum?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a word.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Excellent. I&#x2019;m down to my last bottle of French brandy, but we&#x2019;ve got&nbsp;quite a lot of rum.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Bring the cask.&#x201d; The general was beginning to show a tinge of color&nbsp;and, at this point, began to be cognizant of his surroundings. &#x201c;You were&nbsp;packing to leave?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am packing to leave, yes,&#x201d; John said, the feeling of wariness developing small, prickling feet inside his stomach. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meant to sail tonight, for&nbsp;Charles Town.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thank God. I was afraid I shouldn&#x2019;t make it in time.&#x201d; The general&nbsp;breathed audibly for a moment, then gathered himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your mother.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>What&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;my mother?&#x201d; The wariness turned instantly to a flare of alarm.&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened to her?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing, yet. Or at least I sincerely hope not.&#x201d; The general patted the&nbsp;air in a vague gesture of reassurance that failed singularly to reassure.<br><br> &#x201c;Where the devil is she? And what in God&#x2019;s name is she up to now?&#x201d;&nbsp;Grey spoke with more heat than filial respect, but panic made him edgy.<br><br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s in Havana,&#x201d; General Stanley said. &#x201c;Minding your cousin Olivia.&#x201d;<br><br> This seemed like a moderately respectable thing for an elderly lady to be&nbsp;doing, and Grey relaxed slightly. But only slightly.<br><br> &#x201c;Is she ill?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope not. She said in her last letter that there was an outbreak of&nbsp;some sort of ague in the city, but she herself was in good health.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Tom had come back with the brandy bottle, and John poured&nbsp;himself a small glass. &#x201c;I trust she&#x2019;s enjoying the weather.&#x201d; He raised an&nbsp;eyebrow at his stepfather, who sighed deeply and put his hands on his&nbsp;knees.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she is. The problem, my boy, is that the British Navy is on its&nbsp;way to lay siege to the city of Havana, and I really think it would be a good&nbsp;idea if your mother wasn&#x2019;t in the city when they get there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment, John stood frozen, glass in hand, mouth open,&nbsp;and his brain so congested with questions that he was unable to articulate&nbsp;any of them. At last, he gulped the remains of his drink, coughed, and said&nbsp;mildly, &#x201c;Oh, I see. How does my mother come to be in Havana to start&nbsp;with?&#x201d;<br><br> The general leaned back and let out a long breath.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all the fault of that Stubbs fellow.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Stubbs . . . ?&#x201d; It sounded vaguely familiar, but stunned as he was, Grey couldn&#x2019;t think why.<br><br> &#x201c;You know, chap who married your cousin Olivia. Looks like a builder&#x2019;s&nbsp;brick. What&#x2019;s his Christian name . . . Matthew? No, Malcolm, that&#x2019;s it. Malcolm Stubbs.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey reached for the brandy bottle, but Tom was already pouring a&nbsp;fresh glass, which he thrust into his employer&#x2019;s hand. He carefully avoided&nbsp;meeting Grey&#x2019;s eye.<br><br> &#x201c;Malcolm Stubbs.&#x201d; Grey sipped brandy, to give himself time to think.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, of course. I . . . take it that he&#x2019;s quite recovered, then?&#x201d; On one&nbsp;level, this was good news; Malcolm Stubbs had lost a foot and part of the&nbsp;adjoining leg to a cannonball at the Battle of Quebec, more than two years&nbsp;before. By good luck, Grey had fallen over him on the field and had the&nbsp;presence of mind to use his belt as a tourniquet, thus preventing Stubbs&nbsp;from bleeding to death. He vividly recalled the splintered bone protruding&nbsp;from the remnants of Malcolm&#x2019;s shin, and the hot, wet smell of blood&nbsp;and shit, steaming in the cold air. He took a deeper swallow of brandy.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, quite. Got an artificial foot, gets around quite well&#x2014;even&nbsp;rides.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good for him,&#x201d; Grey said, rather shortly. There were a few other&nbsp;things he recalled about Malcolm Stubbs. &#x201c;Is&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;in Havana?&#x201d;<br><br> The general looked surprised.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, didn&#x2019;t I say? He&#x2019;s a diplomat of some kind now&#x2014;sent&nbsp;to Havana&nbsp;last September.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A diplomat,&#x201d; Grey repeated. &#x201c;Well, well.&#x201d; Stubbs probably did diplomacy&nbsp;well&#x2014;given&nbsp;his demonstrated skills at lying, deceit, and dishonor. . . .<br><br> &#x201c;He wanted his wife and children to join him in Havana, once he had&nbsp;a suitable establishment, so&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Children? He had <br>only the one son when I last saw him.&#x201d; Only the one&nbsp;legitimate son, he added silently.<br><br> &#x201c;Two, now&#x2014;Olivia&nbsp;gave birth to a daughter two years ago; lovely child&nbsp;called Charlotte.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How nice.&#x201d; His memory of the birth of Olivia&#x2019;s first child, Cromwell,&nbsp;was nearly as horrifyingly vivid as his memories of the Battle of Quebec, if&nbsp;for somewhat different reasons. Both had involved blood and shit, though.<br><br> &#x201c;But Mother&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Your mother offered to accompany Olivia, to help with the children.&nbsp;Olivia&#x2019;s expecting again, and a long sea voyage . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Again?&#x201d; Well, it wasn&#x2019;t as though Grey didn&#x2019;t know what Stubbs&#x2019;s attitude&nbsp;toward sex was . . . and at least the man was doing it with his wife.&nbsp;John kept his temper with some difficulty, but the general didn&#x2019;t notice,&nbsp;continuing with his explanations.<br><br> &#x201c;You see, I was meant to be sailing to Savannah in the spring&#x2014;now,&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean&#x2014;to&nbsp;advise a Colonel Folliott, who&#x2019;s raising a local militia to assist&nbsp;the governor, and your mother was going to come with me. So it seemed&nbsp;reasonable that she go ahead with Olivia and help her to get settled, and I&nbsp;would arrange for her to join me when I came.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Very sensible,&#x201d; John said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mother, then. And where does the&nbsp;British Navy come into it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Admiral Holmes, me lord,&#x201d; Tom said, with a faint air of reproach.&nbsp;&#x201c;He told you last week, when you had him to dinner. He said the Duke of&nbsp;Albemarle was a-coming&nbsp;to take Martinique away from the frogs and then&nbsp;see to Cuba.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. Ah.&#x201d;<br><br> Grey recalled the dinner, which had featured a remarkable dish that he had realized&#x2014;too&nbsp;late&#x2014;was&nbsp;the innards of pickled sea urchins, mixed with bits of raw fish and sea lettuce that had been cured with orange juice. In his desire to keep his guests&#x2014;all&nbsp;recently arrived from London, and all lamenting the dearth of roast beef and potatoes in the Indies&#x2014;from&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;his realization, he had called for lavish and repeated applications of a native palm liquor. This had been very effective; by the second glass, they wouldn&#x2019;t have known they were eating whale turds, should his adventurous&nbsp;cook have taken it into his head to serve that as a second course. Consequently, though, his own memories of the occasion were somewhat dim.<br><br> &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say Albemarle was proposing to lay siege to the place, did&nbsp;he?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, me lord, but that must&#x2019;ve been his meaning, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;God knows,&#x201d; said John, who knew nothing about Cuba, Havana, or&nbsp;the Duke of Albemarle. &#x201c;Or possibly you do, sir?&#x201d; He turned politely to&nbsp;General Stanley, who was beginning to look better, under the influence of&nbsp;relief and brandy. The general nodded.<br><br> &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he admitted frankly, &#x201c;save that I shared Albemarle&#x2019;s table&nbsp;aboard his flagship for six weeks. What I don&#x2019;t presently know about the&nbsp;harbor at Havana probably isn&#x2019;t worth knowing, but I take no credit for&nbsp;the acquisition of that knowledge.&#x201d;<br><br> The general had learned of Albemarle&#x2019;s expedition only the night before the fleet sailed, when a message from the War Office had reached him,&nbsp;ordering him aboard.<br><br> &#x201c;At that point, of course, the ship would reach Cuba long before any message I could send to your mother, so I went aboard at once&#x2014;this&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;he&nbsp;glowered at his &nbsp;bandaged foot&#x2014;&#x201c;&nbsp;notwithstanding.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Quite.&#x201d; John raised a hand in brief interruption and turned to his&nbsp;valet. &#x201c;Tom,&#x2014;run&#x2014;and&nbsp;I do mean&nbsp;<i>run</i>&#x2014;to&nbsp;Admiral Holmes&#x2019;s residence&nbsp;and ask him to call upon me as soon as is convenient. And by convenient,&nbsp;I mean&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right now. Yes, me lord.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Thank you, Tom.&#x201d;<br><br> Despite the brandy, Grey&#x2019;s brain had finally grasped the situation and&nbsp;was busy calculating what to do about it.<br><br> If the British Navy showed up in Havana Harbor and started shelling&nbsp;the place, it wasn&#x2019;t merely physical danger threatening the Stubbs family&nbsp;and Lady Stanley, also known as the Dowager Duchess of Pardloe.

If you put aside reality.<br><br>Sunset Boulevard, Sunday at ten thirty p.m., was an easy ride, cool April air sweetening the Seville&#x2019;s interior. To get here from my place in Beverly Glen, I&#x2019;d driven through Bel Air and Brentwood, turned south a quarter mile into Pacific Palisades, continued through tree-lined stretches of architectural revivals: Colonial, Spanish, Mediterranean, Greek, Unidentifiable.<br><br>Not a Through Street warnings at most corners; a planned community discouraging casual visitors. GPS-tutored turns led me to a street named Evada Lane, three blocks terminating at a cul-de-sac.<br><br>Built-in-the-seventies tract, the Palisades but no palisades in sight. This was flat land, geographically undistinguished, too far from the ocean for someone to smell the brine.<br><br>In the Midwest, respectably middle-class real estate. In L.A., not a single structure worth less than a million.<br><br>The house garnering all the attention sat at the tip of the dead end like a cherry on a sundae. One of the aspiring Colonials, heralded by white columns, its brick fa�ade strobed red and blue by LAPD cruisers. The same light show played upon a black Range Rover and a gray Lexus sedan in the driveway.<br><br>All that wattage courtesy of half a dozen cop cars, circled around a white crypt van waiting to transport. The crime lab van sat nearby, lights off, unoccupied. No sign of the coroner&#x2019;s investigators; come and gone.<br><br>Uniformed officers stood around doing nothing. Radios barked police calls, dispatchers&#x2019; voices impersonal as they chronicled the evening&#x2019;s malice and misfortune.<br><br>Soft, spring breeze; the yellow tape billowed.<br><br>Just outside the tape, a mud-colored Impala I knew to be Detective Moses Reed&#x2019;s current ride sat next to a white Porsche 928 in which I&#x2019;d been a passenger more than once. The off-duty drive shared by Lieutenant Milo Sturgis and his partner, a trauma surgeon named Richard Silverman.<br><br>Reed had arrived just over two hours ago, taken one look, and called the boss. Milo, suffering through a charity dinner for Rick&#x2019;s employer, the Cedars-Sinai E.R., sped over from the Beverly Hilton and called me.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Complicated, see for yourself. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>He met me just outside the front door, wearing a hooded paper suit, booties, and gloves.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I know, I look like a giant sperm. You don&#x2019;t have to abase yourself, tech&#x2019;s nearly finished.&#x201d; He peeled off the suit, revealing a saggy black suit with lapels dating to the house&#x2019;s construction, a white shirt, and a silver tie that had to be Rick&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Very GQ.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The almost-tux?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Damn banquet, I had to take the pants out three inches, four woulda been better&#x2014;enough of my problems, let&#x2019;s go see a real one.&#x201d;<br><br>The paper garb had led me to expect horror and chaos. Milo opened the door on surprising calm.<br><br>A two-story entry floored in waxed walnut was centered by a mahogany table hosting a vase of silk roses. A bronze chandelier cast reassuring light. To the left, blandly pleasant landscape paintings filled a white wall; to the right a blue-carpeted staircase traced the ascent to a small landing.<br><br>Milo continued straight ahead, toward another wall decorated by sconces and broken by an open doorway.<br><br>A form moved into the gap. Moe Reed, young, ruddy, still wearing his paper suit but not the hood. Pink skin showed through his blond buzz cut. The suit was tight in places, power-lifter arms testing the tensile strength of wood pulp.<br><br>&#x201c;L.T., Doc.&#x201d; Stepping aside.<br><br>I followed Milo into a modestly proportioned, nicely set-up living room that ended at a bank of French doors. Through the glass were glimpses of patio furniture, grass, trees. To the left, a dining room and, beyond that, another open doorway that led to a white kitchen.<br><br>When people are murdered in their homes, it&#x2019;s almost always in the bedroom or the kitchen. Milo kept going, crossing the living room and hooking right, toward a closed door.<br><br>He knocked.<br><br>A female voice said, &#x201c;Hold on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a sec, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br>The door opened on a paper-suited lab tech name-tagged I. Jonas. The mask was pulled down, revealing a young female face the color of hot chocolate. Tweezers in one hand, vial in the other, something black and wormy in the vial.<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Just a few secs and I&#x2019;ll be gone, sir, but you can come in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Milo. &#x201c;I want Dr. Delaware to take a look.&#x201d;<br><br>I. Jonas looked at me. &#x201c;Pathologist actually came to the scene?&#x201d;<br><br>Milo said, &#x201c;Different ologist. Psych.&#x201d;<br><br>The tech gave me a longer once-over. &#x201c;Inez Jonas, Doctor. I&#x2019;d shake your hand but obviously.&#x201d; She shifted to the right, gave me a fuller view.<br><br>The room was cozy and pine-paneled. What looked to be a library/den/office combo, with a book-filled repro-Victorian case and a matching desk. The desk&#x2019;s tooled-leather top was bare but for a green-shaded lamp and a glass jar filled with hard candies wrapped in multicolored foil. To the left of the desk was an open area. A plaid sofa and ottoman faced a sixty-inch TV.<br><br>That left plenty of floor space for the man lying on hardwood, between the couch and the screen.<br><br>Positioned faceup if he&#x2019;d had a face.<br><br>The devastation visited on everything above his neck suggested a shotgun attack, and I asked if that was the case.<br><br>Inez Jonas said, &#x201c;You bet, Doctor, tons of pellets in there.&#x201d; She frowned as her eyes trailed to where the man&#x2019;s hands should&#x2019;ve been. I&#x2019;d already gotten there.<br><br>Dual amputation at the wrists, clean and straight-edged. Stiffness in the limbs.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Still in rigor.&#x201d;<br><br>Milo nodded. &#x201c;C.I. says depending on temperature, he was probably killed within twenty-hour hours, probably less. She&#x2019;s also sure the hands were cut off postmortem because there wasn&#x2019;t much bleeding at the stumps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not much blood, period.&#x201d;<br><br>Inez Jonas said, &#x201c;No kidding. I found a few little drops on the wood just under him, no spatter either high- or low-velocity, just a teeny bit of runoff from here.&#x201d; Pointing to the neck, which canted to the right. A wispy streak the color of ros� wine trailed down gray flesh.<br><br>She held the vial up to Milo. &#x201c;The other thing I found was this, just before you came back. On the floor, under his butt.&#x201d;<br><br>He squinted. &#x201c;Plastic?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; said Jonas. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s just random dirt that was already here and his pants picked it up. But I&#x2019;m thinking it looks like it&#x2019;s from a garbage bag and that could explain how they got him here, no? &#x2019;Cause he sure wasn&#x2019;t killed here. Or cut up here.&#x201d;<br><br>Milo said, &#x201c;Done somewhere else, cleaned up meticulously, and bagged. Once he&#x2019;s here, bad guy does some fine-tuning and takes the bag. Yeah, I like it, good thinking.&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas beamed. &#x201c;Psycho-crazy thinking but logical if you&#x2019;re in that orbit.&#x201d;<br><br>Looking at the corpse had made my eyes and teeth hurt so I shifted to a visual scan of the room. But for the corpse, as impeccable as the rest of the house.<br><br>I looked down at the poor faceless soul again, trying to ignore the gore and concentrating on the mundane details that sometimes tell you plenty.<br><br>Not tonight.<br><br>Medium height, medium build, age impossible to discern but thinning sandy hair and a bald spot suggested middle age. So did the clothing: a pale-blue button-collar shirt, tan windbreaker, pleated blue jeans pretending to be slacks, white socks, white Nike walking shoes. The pockets of the jeans had been turned inside out.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Was he left that way?&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas said, &#x201c;No, Doctor. C.I. went looking for the I.D. and turned them out. They were empty. Same for the jacket pockets.&#x201d;<br><br>Milo said, &#x201c;No face, no hands, no I.D., pretty obvious what the goal was. Now the big question: How the hell did he end up here when the homeowners say they have no idea who he is?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Where are the owners?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nearby.&#x201d; He stared at the body, scowled, and played with an earlobe. His big, pale, acne-pitted face tightened as he brushed black hair off a lumpy forehead. A speck of some kind of foodstuff from the interrupted dinner sat just above his upper lip, left of center. Off-white, maybe rubber chicken. Or cheese. Another time, I&#x2019;d have pointed it out.<br><br>Inez Jonas looked at me again. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a weird one, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ergo, a psychologist. Any first-impression insights, Alex?&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Who are the owners?&#x201d;<br><br>My non-answer made Milo frown. &#x201c;A family, the Corvins. They left for a family dinner at six fifteen, Sunday thing, they do it once, twice a month. Usually they stay local. This time, they took a drive all the way to La Cienega, Lawry&#x2019;s, Restaurant Row. They get back just before nine, everyone goes upstairs except Dad who comes in here to record a show on his big-screen and finds this. Moments later, Mom comes down to ask him what&#x2019;s taking so long and screams and that brings the kids down and now it&#x2019;s a family affair.&#x201d;<br><br>Inez Jonas said, &#x201c;Talk about a welcome home.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;How many kids and what age?&#x201d;<br><br>Milo said, &#x201c;Coupla teenagers, or the young one&#x2019;s a tweener. They did the smart thing and ran the hell out and knocked on the neighbor&#x2019;s door. He&#x2019;s the one who 911&#x2019;d. If you&#x2019;ve seen enough here, I&#x2019;d like you to meet them.&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Inez Jonas said, &#x201c;Good luck, Lieutenant.&#x201d; Her expression said, You&#x2019;re going to need it.<br><br>Moe Reed was still posted in the doorway, working his phone. &#x201c;Anything, L.T.?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, go home, patrol can guard the scene.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure? I&#x2019;ve got time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Positive, Moses.&#x201d; He told Reed about the scrap of plastic. &#x201c;Could mean something or nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>Reed said, &#x201c;Too bad those bags are pretty much generic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bloody one isn&#x2019;t, Moses. On your way out, have a bunch of those uniforms do a six-block search for the bag&#x2014;for anything bloody. It&#x2019;s unlikely someone who took the time to cut off hands and take I.D. would be careless enough to toss evidence out in the open, but we can&#x2019;t assume.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll canvass with them,&#x201d; said Reed. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t notice any alleys or dumpsters on my way in, but there is that shopping area a few blocks west, got to be plenty of potential dump spots near there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent idea.&#x201d;<br><br>Reed stripped off his paper suit. His on-call civilian threads were a gray Gold&#x2019;s Gym T-shirt and white sweatpants. Bouncing on his heels a couple of times, he jogged out of the house.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, youth,&#x201d; said Milo.<br><br>As we left the house, I said, &#x201c;How many points of access?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t count windows, the front door, a service door from a laundry room off the kitchen, and those French doors. Everything was locked when the Corvins got home, but the laundry door looks pretty dinky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any security system?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;An alarm, they&#x2019;re pretty sure they didn&#x2019;t set it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Casual approach to personal safety,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice neighborhood,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;People get lulled. The system came with the house, sensors on the ground floor but not the second. Like bad guys can&#x2019;t bring ladders. We looked for evidence of a ladder, any sort of disruption, couldn&#x2019;t find any, and the second-story windows were all closed. I&#x2019;m leaning toward the utility door as point of entry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Someone familiar with the place? Knowing the lock was dinky?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would explain it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yet another reason to play Meet the Family.&#x201d; He scowled.<br><br>I said, &#x201c;These people bother you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So far, nothing says they&#x2019;re dirty. But something about them, Alex&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll let you be the judge.&#x201d;</p><h2>Christmas at The Mysterious Bookshop</h2><p>Each year, for the past seventeen years, Otto Penzler, owner of the legendary Mysterious Bookshop in New York City, has commissioned an original story by a leading mystery writer. The requirements were that it be a mystery/ crime/suspense story, that it be set during the Christmas season, and that at least some of the action must take place in The Mysterious Bookshop. These stories were then produced as pamphlets, 1,000 copies, and given to customers of the bookstore as a Christmas present.<p>Now, all of these stories have been collected in one volume<i>Christmas at the Mysterious Bookshop</i>. Some of the tales are humorous, others suspenseful, and still others mystifying. This charming one-of-a-kind collection is a perfect Christmas gift, appropriate for all ages and tastes.</p><p>Contributors include:</p><p>Charles Ardai<br>Lisa Atkinson<br>George Baxt<br>Lawrence Block<br>Mary Higgins Clark<br>Thomas H.

He lives in New York City.Every year since 1993, Penzler, founder of The Mysterious Bookshop in New York, has asked a different genre writer to produce a short story to be published and given away as a Christmas gift to customers. The only requirements: the story must be set around the Christmas season, and it must involve the bookshop in its action. This very entertaining anthology contains all of the stories published so far, by such writers as Donald E. Westlake, Lawrence Block, Anne Perry, Mary Higgins Clark, Andrew Klavan, and Ed McBain. The stories&#x2014;every single one of them&#x2014;are delightful, and there&#x2019;s something for everyone, too: funny stories, serious stories, charming stories, silly stories. Any time writers of this caliber are collected between the same covers, it&#x2019;s a can&#x2019;t-miss opportunity for mystery buffs. Even those who might find the Christmas trappings on the treacly side will enjoy the stories as stories. --David Pitt</p><h2>Fasting (The Ancient Practices)</h2><p><p><b>Building a body and mind that hungers for God. </b></p><p>Is the practice of faith centered solely on the spirit? Is the body an enemy, or can it actually play a role in our pursuit of God? In this installation of the <i>Ancient Practices Series</i>, Dr. Scot McKnight reconnects the spiritual and the physical through the discipline of fasting.&nbsp; </p><p>The act of fasting, he says, should not be focused onresults or used as a manipulative tool. It is a practice to be used in responseto sacred moments, just as it has in the lives of God's people throughout history. McKnight gives us scriptural accounts of fasting, along with practical wisdom on benefits and pitfalls, when we should fast, and what happens to our bodies as a result. </p><p>For those who have wondered how to grasp thevalue of this most misunderstood ancient<br>practice, this book is a comprehensive guide. </p></p><p><p>Scot McKnight (PhD, Nottingham) is the Julius R. Mantey Professor of New Testament at Northern Seminary in Lombard, Illinois.

Reissue.</p><p>This collection of short stories includes tales that take place before <i>The Vor Game</i> and others extending past <i>Brothers in Arms</i>. The variation in tone across the tales is handled exceptionally well, as we see Miles mourn and get a better look at his relationship with Illyan. The stories include Miles's first outing as a detective, in which he's faced with a case of infanticide in the mutant-phobic hill country; his largest rescue mission ever; and the most distressed damsel for whom he ever played the knight.<i>Author's Note</i>:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Vorkosigan Saga Reading Order Debate: The Chef Recommends</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to read what have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books, the Vorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names, since I neglected to supply the series with a label myself.&nbsp; The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so volumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order.&nbsp; I favor internal chronological, with a few caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because, in the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because if I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately with <i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i>) it would upwhack the numbering system.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was always my intention to write each book as a stand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with that book that's in your hand <i>right now</i>, don't put it back on the shelf!&nbsp; While still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other.&nbsp; I will list the sub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i>&nbsp; The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.&nbsp; <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>.&nbsp; For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.)&nbsp; <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.</p><h2>The Earth Path: Grounding Your Spirit in the Rhythms of Nature</h2><p><p>From time immemorial, artists and poets, prophets, and shamans have drawn strength and inspiration from walking the earth. In <em>The Earth Path,</em> bestselling author Starhawk takes the reader on a journey into the heart of the natural world, showing how we can have a more intimate connection with the world that surrounds us.</p><p>Institutionalized religions have sacred texts -- messages written in holy books that are the inspiration for their beliefs and rituals. But the sacred texts for Wicca, like other ancient native or indigenous traditions, are written in nature -- in the magic circle of the elements: air, fire, water, and earth. With <em>The Earth Path,</em> Starhawk, an activist, ecofeminist, and leader in the women&#x2019;s spirituality movement, places you in the center of that magical circle. As you become attuned to the rhythms of the earth, your thinking will shift from focusing on isolated objects to marveling at the multitude of interconnecting patterns and relationships in nature. These patterns and connections can hold the key to your own spiritual renewal and restore your sense of responsibility for preserving this world that nurtures and sustains us.</p><p>Filled with awareness exercises, inspiring meditations, and magical rituals, <em>The Earth Path</em> not only teaches the reader to respect the ecology of our natural world, but shows how to spiritually connect with and channel the powers inherent in nature.</p></p><p>Starhawk is the author of nine books, including her bestselling <em>The Spiral Dance, The Pagan Book of Living and Dying,</em> and <em>Webs of Power,</em> winner of the 2003 Nautilus Award for social change. She has an international reputation, and her works have been translated into many different languages. Starhawk is also a columnist for beliefnet.com and ZNet. A veteran of progressive movements who is deeply committed to bringing the techniques and creative power of spirituality to political activism, she travels internationally, teaching magic, the tools of ritual, and the skills of activism. Starhawk lives part-time in San Francisco, in a collective house with her partner and friends, and part-time in a little hut in the woods in western Sonoma County, where she practices permaculture in her extensive gardens and writes.Fans and followers of Starhawk (<i>The Spiral Dance</i>; etc.), a founding member of the Reclaiming Tradition of Witchcraft, will welcome her latest offering. Well organized, each chapter contains reminiscences of personal and group experiences, exercises and suggestions for prayer and ritual. Many of her tenets apply not only to those interested in the practice of Wicca but to readers seeking a better understanding of the world around them: "Once we have learned to hear, then we can begin to understand. And only after we understand do we begin to speak, to intervene." Yet she astutely cautions: "To change a drum rhythm in a group of drummers, you first have to match it and join with it. But when you are within a system, part of the whole, that system is also changing you. It is difficult to maintain your own rhythm and not simply become part of what you are trying to change." Starhawk presents an array of exercises and practices for sharpening observation and listening skills. She engages readers' spirits and minds through her illustrative storytelling, offering ways to communicate more fully with the world and suggesting ways to act. While those unfamiliar with her passion for protest may find themselves distracted by the all-too-frequent appearance of her political soapbox, they will appreciate her tools for connecting with nature. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The killer is still at large, and there&#x2019;s only one surviving witness&#x2014;the boy whose family was killed before his eyes. Whoever committed the crimes wanted this boy to die: he&#x2019;s suffered more than one hundred knife wounds and lapsed into a state of shock. Desperate for information, Linna sees only one option: hypnotism. He enlists Dr. Erik Maria Bark to mesmerize the boy, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s the sort of work that Bark has sworn he would never do again&#x2014;ethically dubious and psychically scarring. When he breaks his promise and hypnotizes the victim, a long and terrifying chain of events begins to unfurl.&nbsp;An international sensation, <i>The Hypnotist</i> is set to appear in thirty-seven countries, and it has landed at the top of bestseller lists wherever it&#x2019;s been published&#x2014;in France, Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Now it&#x2019;s America&#x2019;s turn. Combining the addictive power of the Stieg Larsson trilogy with the storytelling drive of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, this adrenaline-drenched thriller is spellbinding from its very first page.</p><p><p>Lars Kepler is the pseudonym for a literary couple who live and write in Sweden. Their novels, including <i>The Nightmare </i>and <i>The Hypnotist</i>, have been number-one bestsellers in more than a dozen countries, including France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Holland, and Denmark. The forthcoming film version of <i>The Hypnotist</i> is directed by Lasse Hallstr�m (<i>Chocolat</i>, <i>The Cider House Rules</i>).</p>Erik Maria Bark is yanked reluctantly from his dream when the telephone rings. Before he is fully awake, he hears himself say with a smile, &#x201c;Balloons and streamers.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>His heart is pounding from the sudden awakening. Erik has no idea what he meant by these words. The dream is completely gone, as if he had never had it.<br>&nbsp;<br>He fumbles to find the ringing phone, creeping out of the bedroom with it and closing the door behind him to avoid waking Simone. A detective named Joona Linna asks if he is sufficiently awake to absorb important information. His thoughts are still tumbling down into the dark empty space after his dream as he listens.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard you&#x2019;re very skilled in the treatment of acute trauma,&#x201d; says Linna.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>He swallows a painkiller as he listens. The detective explains that he needs to question a fifteen- year- old boy who has witnessed a double murder and been seriously injured himself. During the night he was moved from the neurological unit in Huddinge to the neurosurgical unit at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his condition?&#x201d; Erik asks.<br>&nbsp;<br>The detective rapidly summarizes the patient&#x2019;s status, concluding,<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t been stabilized. He&#x2019;s in circulatory shock and unconscious.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the doctor in charge?&#x201d; asks Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Daniella Richards.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s extremely capable. I&#x2019;m sure she can&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She was the one who asked me to call you. She needs your help. It&#x2019;s urgent.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When Erik returns to the bedroom to get his clothes, Simone is lying on her back, looking at him with a strange, empty expression. A strip of light from the streetlamp is shining in between the blinds.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to wake you,&#x201d; he says softly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who was that?&#x201d; she asks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Police . . . a detective . . . I didn&#x2019;t catch his name.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it about?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I have to go to the hospital,&#x201d; he replies. &#x201c;They need some help with a boy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What time is it, anyway?&#x201d; She looks at the alarm clock and closes her eyes. He notices the stripes on her freckled shoulders from the creased sheets.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sleep now, Sixan,&#x201d; he whispers, calling her by her nickname.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carrying his clothes from the room, Erik dresses quickly in the hall. He catches the flash of a shining blade of steel behind him and turns to see that his son has hung his ice skates on the handle of the front door so he won&#x2019;t forget them. Despite his hurry, Erik finds the protectors in the closet and slides them over the sharp blades.<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s three o&#x2019;clock in the morning when Erik gets into his car. Snow falls slowly from the black sky. There is not a breath of wind, and the heavy flakes settle sleepily on the empty street. He turns the key in the ignition, and the music pours in like a soft wave: Miles Davis, &#x201c;Kind of Blue.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He drives the short distance through the sleeping city, out of Luntmakargatan, along Sveav�gen to Norrtull. He catches a glimpse of the waters of Brunnsviken, a large, dark opening behind the snowfall. He slows as he enters the enormous medical complex, maneuvering between Astrid Lindgren&#x2019;s understaffed hospital and maternity unit, past the radiology and psychiatry departments, to park in his usual place outside the neurosurgical unit. There are only a few cars in the visitors&#x2019; lot. The glow of the streetlamps is reflected in the windows of the tall buildings, and blackbirds rustle through the branches of the trees in the darkness. Usually you hear the roar of the superhighway from here, Erik thinks, but not at this time of night.<br>&nbsp;<br>He inserts his pass card, keys in the six- digit code, enters the lobby, takes the elevator to the fifth floor, and walks down the hall. The blue vinyl floors shine like ice, and the corridor smells of antiseptic. Only now does he become aware of his fatigue, following the sudden surge of adrenaline brought on by the call. It had been such a good sleep, he still feels a pleasant aftertaste.<br>&nbsp;<br>He thinks over what the detective told him on the telephone: a boy is admitted to the hospital, bleeding from cuts all over his body, sweating; he doesn&#x2019;t want to lie down, is restless and extremely thirsty. An attempt is made to question him, but his condition rapidly deteriorates. His level of consciousness declines while at the same time his heart begins to race, and Daniella Richards, the doctor in charge, makes the correct decision not to let the police speak to the patient.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two uniformed cops are standing outside the door of ward N18; Erik senses a certain unease flit across their faces as he approaches. Maybe they&#x2019;re just tired, he thinks, as he stops in front of them and identifies himself. They glance at his ID, press a button, and the door swings open with a hum.<br>&nbsp;<br>Daniella Richards is making notes on a chart when Erik walks in. As he greets her, he notices the tense lines around her mouth, the muted stress in her movements.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Have some coffee,&#x201d; she says.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do we have time?&#x201d; asks Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the bleed in the liver under control,&#x201d; she replies.<br>&nbsp;<br>A man of about forty- five, dressed in jeans and a black jacket, is thumping the coffee machine. He has tousled blond hair, and his lips are serious, clamped firmly together. Erik thinks maybe this is Daniella&#x2019;s husband, Magnus. He has never met him; he has only seen a photograph in her office.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Is that your husband?&#x201d; he asks, waving his hand in the direction of the man.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; She looks both amused and surprised.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I thought maybe Magnus had come with you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she says, with a laugh.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you,&#x201d; teases Erik, starting to walk toward the man.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Daniella&#x2019;s cell phone rings and, still laughing, she flips it open, saying,<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Stop it, Erik,&#x201d; before answering, &#x201c;Daniella Richards.&#x201d; She listens but hears nothing. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; She waits a few seconds, then shrugs. &#x201c;Aloha!&#x201d; she says ironically and flips the phone shut.<br>&nbsp;<br>Erik has walked over to the blond man. The coffee machine is whirring and hissing. &#x201c;Have some coffee,&#x201d; says the man, trying to hand Erik a mug.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The man smiles, revealing small dimples in his cheeks, and takes a sip himself. &#x201c;Delicious,&#x201d; he says, trying once again to force a mug on Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want any.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The man takes another sip, studying Erik. &#x201c;Could I borrow your phone?&#x201d; he asks suddenly. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s okay. I left mine in the car.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And now you want to borrow mine?&#x201d; Erik asks stiffly.<br>&nbsp;<br>The blond man nods and looks at him with pale eyes as gray as polished granite.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You can borrow mine again,&#x201d; says Daniella, who has come up behind Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>He takes the phone, looks at it, then glances up at her. &#x201c;I promise you&#x2019;ll get it back,&#x201d; he says.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only one who&#x2019;s using it anyway,&#x201d; she jokes.<br>&nbsp;<br>He laughs and moves away.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He <i>must </i>be your husband,&#x201d; says Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, a girl can dream,&#x201d; she says with a smile, glancing back at the lanky fellow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Suddenly she looks very tired. She&#x2019;s been rubbing her eyes; a smudge of silver- gray eyeliner smears her cheek.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Shall I have a look at the patient?&#x201d; asks Erik.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; She nods.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As I&#x2019;m here anyway,&#x201d; he hastens to add.<br>&#x201c;Erik, I really do want your opinion, I&#x2019;m not at all sure about this one.&#x201d;</p><h2>Algebra 1: Answer Key &amp; Test Bank</h2><p>Comes with 4 Solutions CDs a and 1 Test Solutions CD.</p><p></p><h2>Root Cellaring: The Simple No-Processing Way to Store Fruits and Vegetables</h2><p>Root cellaring is a method of storing perishable fruits and vegetables, and this guide gives instruction on both improvising a small root cellar and constructing a true root cellar</p><p>Root cellaring, as many people remember but only a few people still practice, is a way of using the earth's naturally cool, stable temperature to store perishable fruits and vegetables. Root cellaring, as Mike and Nancy Bubel explain here, is a no-cost, simple, low-technology, energy-saving way to keep the harvest fresh all year long.<p> In Root Cellaring, the Bubels tell how to successfully use this natural storage approach. It's the first book devoted entirely to the subject, and it covers the subject with a thoroughness that makes it the only book you'll ever need on root cellaring.</p><p> Root Cellaring will tell you: </p><p> * How to choose vegetable and fruit varieties that will store best</p><p> * Specific individual storage requirements for nearly 100 home garden crops</p><p> * How to use root cellars in the country, in the city, and in any environment</p><p> * How to build root cellars, indoors and out, big and small, plain and fancy</p><p> * Case histories -- reports on the root cellaring techniques and experiences of many households all over North America</p><p> Root cellaring need not be strictly a country concept. Though it's often thought of as an adjunct to a large garden, a root cellar can in fact considerably stretch the resources of a small garden, making it easy to grow late succession crops for storage instead of many rows for canning and freezing. Best of all, root cellars can easily fit anywhere. Not everyone can live in the country, but everyone can benefit from natural cold storage.</p>Mike Bubel co-authored the classic best-selling guide<i>&nbsp;Root Cellaring </i>with his wife, Nancy.

Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Sputnik Sweetheart</h2><p>Combining the early, straightforward seductions of <i>Norwegian Woo</i>d and the complex mysteries of <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, this new novel&#x2014;his seventh translated into English&#x2014;is Haruki Murakami at his most satisfying and representative best.<br><br>The scenario is as simple as it is uncomfortable: a college student falls in love (once and for all, despite everything that transpires afterward) with a classmate whose devotion to Kerouac and an untidy writerly life precludes any personal commitments&#x2014;until she meets a considerably older and far more sophisticated businesswoman. It is through this wormhole that she enters Murakami&#x2019;s surreal yet humane universe, to which she serves as guide both for us and for her frustrated suitor, now a teacher. In the course of her travels from parochial Japan through Europe and ultimately to an island off the coast of Greece, she disappears without a trace, leaving only lineaments of her fate: computer accounts of bizarre events and stories within stories. The teacher, summoned to assist in the search for her, experiences his own ominous, haunting visions, which lead him nowhere but home to Japan&#x2014;and there, under the expanse of deep space and the still-orbiting Sputnik, he finally achieves a true understanding of his beloved.<br>A love story, a missing-person story, a detective story&#x2014;all enveloped in a philosophical mystery&#x2014;and, finally, a profound meditation on human longing.<br></p><p><i>Sputnik Sweetheart</i> finds Haruki Murakami in his minimalist mode. Shorter than the sweeping <i>Wind-up Bird Chronicle</i>, less playfully bizarre than <i>A Wild Sheep Chase</i>, the author's seventh novel distills his signature themes into a powerful story about the loneliness of the human condition. "There was nothing solid we could depend on," the reader is told. "We were nearly boundless zeros, just pitiful little beings swept from one kind of oblivion to another."<p> The narrator is a teacher whose only close friend is Sumire, an aspiring young novelist with chronic writer's block. Sumire is suddenly smitten with a sophisticated businesswoman and accompanies her love object to Europe where, on a tiny Greek island, she disappears "like smoke." The schoolteacher hastens to the island in search of his friend. And there he discovers two documents on her computer, one of which reveals a chilling secret about Sumire's lover.</p><p> <i>Sputnik Sweetheart</i> is a melancholy love story, and its deceptively simple prose is saturated with sadness. Characters struggle to connect with one another but never quite succeed. Like the satellite of the title they are essentially alone. And by toning down the pyrotechnics of his earlier work, Murakami has created a world that is simultaneously mundane and disturbing--where doppelg�ngers and vanishing cats produce a pervasive atmosphere of alienation, and identity itself seems like a terribly fragile thing. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>&#x201c;Murakami is a world-class writer who has both eyes open and takes big risks.&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The Washington Post Book World<br></i><br>&#x201c; &#x201c;Grabs you from the opening lines . . .

Daniel, 11, Will, 9, and their father travel to Ohio in 1803 to claim their new land. After hastily building a cabin, Pa returns home to Pennsylvania to fetch Ma and the younger children, intending to come back five or six weeks later. The boys first treat their time alone as an adventure, exploring the woods and fishing in the creek. However, as the weeks stretch into months with still no sign of their parents, the brothers must shift their focus to withstanding the winter. Luckily, a Native American trapper notices them and teaches them some basic survival skills. Still, as snow piles up around them, the youngsters realize how fierce the outdoors can be. Excellent pacing is what makes this novel work so well. From an action-packed beginning to the challenges of a difficult winter, the suspense builds consistently. The boys' struggle is portrayed realistically, without sugarcoating nature's harshness. Daniel and Will also grow and mature as they learn to rely on themselves, their wits, and one another. Not only is this a relevant tie-in to frontier studies, but it is also a good story.<i>&#x2013;Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He has also served on the White House National Security Council staff and on Capitol Hill. He was formerly the history correspondent for Montana Quarterly and an adjunct professor at the University of Montana. He is the author of the international bestselling novel The Revenant and Last Stand: George Bird Grinnell, the battle to Save the Buffalo, and the Birth of the New West. His family home is in Montana.In this compelling tale, Punke recounts the grim details of the worst hard-rock mining disaster in United States history. On June 8, 1917, a fire broke out in the main shaft of a huge complex of copper mines 2,000 feet beneath Granite Mountain in Butte, Mont. The fire raged for three days, killing 164 of the 400 or so men at work that day. Punke, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and novelist (<i>The Revenant</i>), takes the reader deep underground and into the heart of the calamity. If the horrifying account of the fire and the trapped men is the heart of this yarn, its soul is Punke's historical contextualization of the event. He paints a vivid picture of a city, state and nation in the grip of industrial monopolies. In Butte, copper was king and Standard Oil, in the guise of Anaconda Mining, owned most of the copper (though not the Granite Mountain mine). In Punke's telling, Standard Oil spent lavishly to control the municipal and state governments; they aggressively fought the miners' union. Immediately after the tragic fire, the workers violently vented their fury on the hated Anaconda. Like the hardworking miners he writes about, Punke gets the job done, with sturdy prose.<i> (Aug. 8)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this compelling book the acclaimed author of The Invitation challenges readers to live with passion, energy, and honesty. The key, says Oriah, is to savour the everyday world of family, friends, love, and work with clear minds and open hearts. When we are physically and emotionally stressed and our spirits are depleted, we must realise that happiness has not vanished but is buried beneath the clutter of our harried lives. With rare courage and honesty, Oriah unveils the challenge of her inspiring poem through compelling stories from her own experience, offering us tools to become fully the person we already are -- not ways to change."To dance -- to live in a way that is consistent with our longing" -- is to discover a gift that we can give ourselves again and again over a lifetime. To dance, alone or with others, is to be who we truly are as we fulfill our soul&#x2032;s desires. To do this, we must learn how to let go and slow down, returning to the sacred emptiness where we encounter our true self. Practical, inspiring, and profoundly illuminating, The Dance is an invitation to discover a place of connection, serenity, and joy that is uniquely our own."</p></p><p>"What if the question is not why am I so infrequently the person I really want to be, but why do I so infrequently want to be the person I really am?" This is the opening question to <i>The Dance</i>. And like a thematic melody, this is the thread that holds Oriah Mountain Dreamer's book together, as she encourages readers to stop trying to change who you are and simply remember that "who you are is really enough." There are many reasons Mountain Dreamer is such a popular author (her debut book, <i>The Invitation</i>, was a soaring success), the main one being she doesn't pretend to have all the answers. Instead her warm, conversational writing shows us how to "live the questions," as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke once beckoned us to do. When Mountain Dreamer yells at her 19-year-old son, even after vowing to be patient, she asks herself, "Why [do] I repeatedly fail to live the intentions that matter to me? I want to know how to narrow the gap between the sincerest desires of my soul and my daily actions." Living these questions isn't easy, but it is the only way Mountain Dreamer wants to dance. Her chapters explore topics such as greed and money, creating love relationships, overscheduling, and solitude. At the end of each chapter she suggests a fitting mediation or exercise. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p>Oriah is the author of the inspirational prose poem and international bestselling book <em>The Invitation</em> as well as the bestsellers <em>The Dance</em> and <em>The Call</em>. Her writing sets forth in detail how we can follow the thread of our heart's longing into a life of meaning and purpose. Her latest book, <em>What We Ache For: Creativity and the Unfolding of Your Soul</em>, explores creativity as a way of accessing and cultivating a spiritually rich life. Oriah is the mother of two grown sons. She lives with her husband, Jeff, several hours north of Toronto in a home surrounded by forest stillness.</p></p><h2>Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel, 1942</h2><p>You are in San Francisco, and you need a private eye.

He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, and moved to San Francisco in the mid-1950s when he became involved in the emerging beat scene. During the 1960s, he became one of the most prominent and prolific writers of the counterculture. Out of this period came some of his most famous works, the best known of which are <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>; his collection of poetry, <i>The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</i>; and his collection of stories, <i>Revenge of the Lawn</i>. Translated the world over, his works helped establish him as one of the most significant American writers of his generation. As his popularity waned towards the end of the 1970s, he became increasingly disillusioned about his work and his life. He committed suicide in 1984. He was the author of eleven novels, ten volumes of poetry, a collection of short stories, and miscellaneous nonfiction pieces, works that often employed parody, satire, and black comedy.<br><br>An absolute original * * Guardian * * A born writer * * Sunday Times * * Richard Brautigan . . . has invented a genre * * San Francisco Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle * * Undoubtedly funny * * The Times * * He writes with a kind of free-wheeling, zany magic * * Guardian * *</p><h2>Watercolor Pencil Magic</h2><p>Water-soluble colored pencils are portable, versatile and much more forgiving than traditional watercolors, yet many artists have only just begun to tap into this medium&#39;s creative potential. This book explores the amazing possibilities of watercolor pencils, providing artists with basic instruction for taking full advantage of them in their artwork. Beginning with an overview of necessary materials and basic techniques, artists will learn from simple mini demos how to mix colors, create washes, layer colors and more. Artists will then see how these painting techniques are employed to capture a variety of popular subjects, including landscapes, flowers, animals, water, people, skies, trees, bridges and buildings. The last chapter of the book demonstrates how to mix watercolor pencils with other mediums to create all kinds of new and interesting effects.</p><p>Cathy Johnson is the author of five North Light books, including Creating Textures in Watercolor and Watercolor Tricks and Techniques. She has also authored Sierra Club Guide to Sketching Nature and Sierra Club Guide to Painting Nature. She lives in Excelsior Springs, Missouri.A relatively unknown medium, watercolor pencils are a portable, versatile alternative to the traditional watercolor kit. Generally made of pure pigment in a water-soluble wax base enclosed in a wooden pencil, they are used dry for sketching but when moistened easily create washes and multiple layers of color. Johnson is a prolific author and artist with 25 books to her credit, including Sketching and Drawing. Here, she introduces this unique medium with simple mini-demos on the basics and fully developed compositions of landscapes, flowers, bridges, and buildings. Large collections will want to add this, though small libraries may want a more general book that includes a section on watercolor pencils, such as Janie Gildow and Barbara Newton's Colored Pencil Solution Book. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The First Epistle to the Corinthians (The New International Commentary on the New Testament)</h2><p>Incorporating the best elements of previous works, this replacement volume in the New International Commentary on the New Testament offers a readable, verse-by-verse exposition of the English and Greek texts of First Corinthians.

Only by gaining an awareness and understanding of one&#39;s unconscious mind and true, inner nature-&#34;the undiscovered self&#34;-can we as individuals acquire the self-knowledge that is antithetical to ideological fanaticism. But this requires that we face our fear of the duality of the human psyche-the existence of good and the capacity for evil in every individual. In this seminal book, Jung compellingly argues that only then can we begin to cope with the dangers posed by mass society-&#34;the sum total of individuals&#34;-and resist the potential threats posed by those in power.</p><p><b>Sonu Shamdasani</b> is editor of <i>The Red Book</i> and Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Eight Doors of the Kingdom: Meditations on the Beatitudes [Paperback]</h2><p>The Gospel of St. Matthew Shares with us astonishing words of Jesus: a promise of everlasting happiness, far removed from the usual recipes for gratification.

Or are you frustrated, knowing that no matter how hard you try, the open-heartedness that first drew you and your partner together seems awfully hard to win back? Perhaps you&#x2019;re in a difficult relationship that needs substantial change, or perhaps you are in a good-enough relationship that could be made better. Maybe you&#x2019;re looking for a new relationship that doesn&#x2019;t repeat the mistakes of the past. In any case, if you are reading these words, chances are you feel that something has been missing. It may be tempting to avoid acknowledging that feeling, but I&#x2019;d like to ask you to trust your instinct. Twenty-five years of helping couples change and grow has taught me that if you feel things could be better, you&#x2019;re probably right. A lot better, in fact.<br><br>People may tell you that what you&#x2019;re looking for is unrealistic. I don&#x2019;t think so. Well-meaning friends and family may focus on your need to compromise. I don&#x2019;t want you to. Your relationship is too important for compromise. Your work may be rewarding, your kids great, and your friends wonderful, but in the end, your bond with the person you live out your life with&#x2014;the one you grow up and grow old with&#x2014;is the single most important connection you will ever have. I want you to go after what it is that you want&#x2014;with skill and with love&#x2014;and get it.<br><br>Both in counseling couples and in workshops I&#x2019;ve lead around the country, I have taught people from all walks of life how to turn bad relationships into good ones, and good relationships into great ones. Because great is what you&#x2019;re really after. Great is what you deserve. Not merely a relationship you can live with, but one that is truly alive&#x2014;passionately, tenderly, maddeningly filled to the brim with unexpected twists and turns, with comfort and solidity, with the sense of knowing and being known, and loving one another anyway. How do you get such a relationship? You don&#x2019;t get it, you build it, thoughtfully and skillfully, brick by brick.<br><br>Do you have the skills to do this? Have you been taught the craft of creating and sustaining a truly great relationship? If you&#x2019;re like most of us, your upbringing&#x2014;that curious mixture of what you&#x2019;ve picked up about how to be close from society in general and from your family in particular&#x2014;has not only failed to give you the tools you need, but has actively filled your head with a bunch of unhelpful nonsense. Nonsense like &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better not make him too angry.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;If she really loved me, she&#x2019;d . . .&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;I could be happy if only you&#x2019;d . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Like a tennis player who&#x2019;s performed well enough with rotten technique, in order to master relationships you don&#x2019;t just have to learn how to do it; first you have to unlearn all your bad habits. Think of me as your intimacy coach. Together, we&#x2019;re going to strip down your usual relationship routines and redo them, from the very basics. Will it be comfortable? Probably not. If it is, it means I&#x2019;m not doing my job. Imagine going out on a tennis court with a totally new grip after years of holding your racquet in one familiar way. Comfortable? No. But does the new, proper grip give you a more effective stroke? Once you get used to it, there&#x2019;s no comparison.<br><br>Reading this, a part of you may be wondering, &#x201c;Has the game of love really grown so technical that I need an intimacy coach just to have a decent relationship? Whatever happened to falling in love and, well . . . just getting along?&#x201d; That kind of spontaneity is fine&#x2014;if it&#x2019;s working for you. Ask yourself: Is it? If you&#x2019;re like most people, the honest answer is somewhere between a definite no and &#x201c;Not as well as I wish it would.&#x201d; If that&#x2019;s the case, don&#x2019;t be embarrassed; you&#x2019;re in an awfully big boat. The truth is that navigating your relationship by simply doing what &#x201c;comes naturally&#x201d; actually stacks the odds against achieving lasting happiness. Roughly half of all marriages fail altogether, and of those marriages left standing, how many are really fulfilling? How many truly great relationships do you see around you? Everywhere you turn, it seems that people who can be terrific parents, friends, workers, and neighbors fall short in the one arena that matters the most. As if that weren&#x2019;t sobering enough, consider this: The grim picture of relationships I&#x2019;m describing has been relatively stable for the last forty years. The emergence of couple&#x2019;s therapy in the 1950s has done nothing to change it. Self-help and psychology haven&#x2019;t put a dent in it. Multimillion-dollar government programs and church initiatives have been helpless in the face of our current intimacy crisis. What is going on?<br><br>Twenty-first Century Love<br><br>Try as they might, most &#x201c;experts&#x201d; aren&#x2019;t helping much because they fail to address the fundamental issue. What&#x2019;s robbing your relationship of the closeness and passion you deserve is history; or, more precisely, your particular moment in history. If you are like the millions of men and women who feel dissatisfied, you have been trying to negotiate a twenty-first century relationship using twentieth-century skills. Your expectations of what an intimate relationship is&#x2014;emotional sharing, mutual support, responsibility, vitality&#x2014;belong to a new kind of marriage, one very different from your parents&#x2019; or grandparents&#x2019;. But your old rule book, and your bag of relationship tools&#x2014;your game plan and ways of coping&#x2014;are not nearly as fresh as your vision is.<br><br>The Big Picture: Where Are We Now?<br><br>One of the reasons why men and women are so frustrated and confused with one another is that the nature of marriage itself is undergoing a sea of change.<br><br>In the beginning of the twentieth century, with the coming of the industrial revolution, men left their farms in droves and moved into the city to work. Before urbanization everyone pitched in together in all sorts of ways, but from then on men began working away from their families while women and children stayed home. The great roles for men and women of the twentieth century were forged: Man-the-Breadwinner and Woman-the-Caretaker. Both at home and in school, children were raised to have character traits that suited these roles. Boys learned to be strong, goal oriented, and competitive; girls learned to be caring, emotional, and cooperative. For at least fifty years, this arrangement, if not always equally rewarding for both partners, was nevertheless largely stable. Through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, divorce was exceptional, and in all but the most extreme cases, if marital unhappiness existed, it was kept discreetly behind closed doors.<br><br>In the second half of the twentieth century, the sleeping giant of half the population began to wake up. Starting in the 1970s and mov- ing with accelerating pace, women became the largest addition to the workforce. Women gained economic freedom, political power, a new psychology, and a collective drive to support feminine strength and independence. The women&#x2019;s movement changed our society forever.<br><br>Newly empowered, women across America turned to men and began insisting on levels of emotional intimacy that most men&#x2014;raised under the old regime&#x2014;were not readily able to meet.<br><br>The reason why things have been so difficult between men and women in the last several decades can be pared down to this: In the last generation women have radically changed and men, by and large, have not. This is not a criticism of men. It is a simple fact.<br><br>If Woman the Caretaker was compliant and repressed, the new Liberated Woman was armed and angry, leaving many men feeling unappreciated and bewildered. &#x201c;What do they want from us?&#x201d; men asked. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t they accept us for who we are?&#x201d; On the women&#x2019;s side, finding a &#x201c;good man,&#x201d; a man who &#x201c;got it,&#x201d; seemed to grow more and more difficult. If the ancient Greeks identified with heroic Odysseus setting sail for adventure, we moderns cheer on Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda of Sex and the City, as they quest for a satisfying heterosexual relationship, or as Charlotte once put it, &#x201c;to dream the impossible dream!&#x201d;<br><br>What most of the men I work with don&#x2019;t &#x201c;get&#x201d; is that their relationship job description has changed. According to the unspoken rules governing traditional twentieth-century marriage if a man was a reliable provider, a steady hand, and didn&#x2019;t drink a lot or beat anyone, he was a good husband. A generation ago, if a woman went to her mother and complained of such a spouse that &#x201c;He never takes my feelings seriously,&#x201d; or &#x201c;He puts me down in public,&#x201d; or &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so shut down I feel like I live with a stranger,&#x201d; what do you imagine she would have been told? Stop whining, suck it up, and go home&#x2014;of course! But we have outgrown those rules, and now it is just such quality-of-relationship issues that break up modern couples&#x2014;or, perhaps worse, render a once loving union chronically miserable. Just as women&#x2019;s roles have radically changed, so, too, have their expectations of long-term relationships. While many men would be delighted if women retained more of their traditional caretaker role, most women need men to be more than providers. The refrain I hear over and over again from dissatisfied women is &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel like I have a real partner.&#x201d; A partner who shares in the details of domestic life and in her concerns about the kids. An intellectual partner who cares about what she thinks and supports her development. And most of all, an emotional partner who shows interest in and appreciation for her feelings and who has a few feelings of his own ...</p><h2>Soul on Ice</h2><p>Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Minister of Information and former Candidate for the Presidency of the United States on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, here writes about the forces that shaped his life and that are currently molding our national destiny, This book, written while the author was in California&#39;s Folsom State Prison, has the terrifying lucidity of a calm before the storm.

Far from provincial, this extraordinary woman tells us about her business ventures in Lynn, her spiritual conversion and asceticism, and her travels all around Europe and the Holy Land while on pilgrimage. Kempe presents a splendidly detailed perspective of a woman from the rising middle class of the late Middle Ages, of a frequent pilgrim, and of a would-be saint gifted with spectacular crying. This edition, faithful to the original Middle English text but edited for accessibility to students, includes a gloss, notes, introduction, and a glossary, making The Book of Margery Kempe an excellent choice for any class interested in religion, gender, travel, or even daily life in late medieval Europe.</p><p>The first autobiography written in English--by a brewery owner, Christian mystic, and mother of 14 named Margery Kempe, who died in the 15th century--is now available in a lively, modern translation by John Skinner. It begins with her stark conversion experience, heralded by a vision of Christ in her bedroom one night. The story follows Margery through pilgrimages across Europe and to the Holy Land, through a heresy trial in England, and her burgeoning mystical life. Similar in many ways to <i>Showings</i> by Julian of Norwich and the <i>Confessions</i> of Augustine, <i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i> is a beautiful description of medieval daily life and religious experience. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Though a familiar name, little was known about the English mystic Margery Kempe (c. 1373-c. 1440) for hundreds of years except that she had an association with the great Julian of Norwich. This all changed in 1934 with the discovery of <i>The Book of Margery Kempe</i> in a library where it had lain hidden for four hundred years. Finding Margery's own story was important not just because of the light it shed on her life, but it also turned out to be the first known autobiography in the English language. Even more intriguing to the experts of the day, this unique document was written by a woman.<br><br>But if anyone had expected to find her anything like her cloistered contemporary, Julian, they were in for something of a surprise. Far from being a typical holy woman, Margery Kempe was married and mother of fourteen children. Moreover, she had been a woman of substance, even running a large brewery for a time. After turning to religion, she traveled thousands of miles around the known world on pilgrimages to distant lands.<br><br>Beyond the circumstances of her life, what's most compelling about the text is the inner Margery that emerges. Her account of spiritual awakening, far from being a blissful episode is instead full of conflict and recrimination. What good was this new way of life if it caused her such trouble? Was this really the only way to lead a holy life? Margery remained unsure of the answers. But her patience in her struggle is a wonder to behold, and an example for us today.</p><h2>The story of redemption: A concise presentation of the conflict of the ages drawn from the earlier writings of Ellen G.

Over the next twenty-six days, the bright, blond New England collegian lived at the Barbizon Hotel, attended Balanchine ballets, watched a game at Yankee Stadium, and danced at the West Side Tennis Club. She typed rejection letters to writers from <em>The New Yorker</em> and ate an entire bowl of caviar at an advertising luncheon. She stalked Dylan Thomas and fought off an aggressive diamond-wielding delegate from the United Nations. She took hot baths, had her hair done, and discovered her signature drink (vodka, no ice).

Most of the projects involve knitting in the round, so a thorough overview explains the technique, as well as basic hat forms, choosing a yarn, and accessible techniques such as felting. Try a shaped ribbon yarn hat with equally decorative and functional earflaps. A simple brimmed felted wool hat becomes a fashion statement with a brightly colored decorative edging. Whip up a chunky seed stitch cap in just a matter of hours. Even the simplest designs are stylish, using great color combinations and yarns with irresistible textures. And, because the patterns come with both medium and large sizes, you can knit to fit.<br><br></p><p>The good news about this book is that it has instructions for some of the cutest hats, caps, and berets ever pulled together for a knitting collection. The not-so-good news is that most of the projects are done in the round on double-pointed needles, which tends to scare off less-experienced knitters. Carron makes a game effort to explain the techniques, and it is possible from the sharp photo illustrations to get the general ideal, but whether a knitter could actually learn how to do this kind of knitting from a book is debatable. Still, these projects are so enticing (and fashionable!) that many will want to try. Special attention is given to a discussion of various types of yarn, and there are also explanations of related techniques such as felting. Unlike many hat instructions, these come in two sizes, medium and large. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His books have sold in the millions of copies, and he was one of the most popular authors of the day on both sides of the Atlantic.<p></p> <p>Drawn to the pulpit early, MacDonald eventually left to pursue his writing. Numbered among Dickens, Trollope, and other giants of the age as a novelist, MacDonald ended his career with over fifty books ranging from fantastical literature, to children's stories, to critical essays, and numerous novels. In addition to writing, MacDonald lectured extensively. </p> <p>MacDonald's fiction combined the man's immense spiritual understanding with his innate storytelling ability. His works have influenced writers like C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and many others. </p> <p><b>Michael Phillips</b> is an author, editor, publisher, and bookseller. He's written nearly 50 books, including many best sellers, and his current total book sales have capped five million.</p> <p>He's also the editor of 25 books by 19th-century author George MacDonald (Bethany House).

Tour.</p><p>The United States and Britain had already negotiated an end to the War of 1812 when their troops met on the Plains of Chalmette near New Orleans in 1815. Word of the peace had not yet reached that far west, so a group of professional British soldiers clashed with a rag-tag band of about 4,000 "frontiersmen, militiamen, regular soldiers, free men of color, Indians, pirates, and townspeople" along the banks of the Mississippi River. These were "citizen-soldiers" in the finest sense, writes Robert V. Remini, the acclaimed biographer of Andrew Jackson, and they were commanded by a man whose military experience had commenced only two years earlier. Yet the battle "was one of the great turning points in American history" because it "produced a President and an enduring belief in the military ability of free people to protect and preserve their society and their way of life." Remini may oversell the battle's importance, but not by much. His enthusiasm is the mark of a historian in love with his subject. The Battle of New Orleans (and the War of 1812 in general) has tended to suffer more from neglect than from too much attention. This concise book, full of workmanlike prose, is a fine introduction to what Remini calls "America's first military victory" (he downplays Saratoga and Yorktown as "simply surrenders, nothing more"). Military history buffs won't want to miss it. <i>--John J. Miller</i><b>Robert V.

In the book, these subjects are explored by Penelope herself&#x2013;telling the story from Hades &#x2014; the Greek afterworld <b>-</b> in wry, sometimes acid tones. But Penelope&#x2019;s maids also figure as a singing and dancing chorus (and chorus line)<b>,</b> commenting on the action in poems, songs, an anthropology lecture and even a videotaped trial. <br><br><i>The Penelopiad</i> does several dazzling things at once. First, it delves into a moment of casual brutality and reveals all that the act contains: a practice of sexual violence and gender prejudice our society has not outgrown. But it is also a daring interrogation of Homer&#x2019;s poem, and its counter-narratives &#x2014; which draw on mythic material not used by Homer <b>- </b>cleverly unbalance the original. This is the case throughout, from the unsettling questions that drive Penelope&#x2019;s tale forward, to more comic doubts about some of <b>The Odyssey</b>&#x2019;s most famous episodes. (&#x201c;Odysseus had been in a fight with a giant one-eyed Cyclops, said some; no, it was only a one-eyed tavern keeper, said another, and the fight was over non-payment of the bill.&#x201d;)<br><br>In fact, <b>The Penelopiad</b><i> </i>weaves and unweaves the texture of <b>The Odyssey</b><i> </i>in several searching ways. <b>The Odyssey</b><i> </i>was originally a set of songs, for example; the new version&#x2019;s ballads and idylls complement and clash with the original. Thinking more about theme, the maids&#x2019; voices add a new and unsettling complex of emotions that is missing from Homer. <b>The Penelopiad</b><i> </i>takes what was marginal and brings it to the centre, where one can see its full complexity. <br><br>The same goes for its heroine. Penelope is an important figure in our literary culture, but we have seldom heard her speak for herself. Her sometimes scathing comments in <b>The Penelopiad </b>(about her cousin, Helen of Troy, for example) make us think of Penelope differently &#x2013; and the way she talks about the twenty-first century, which she observes from Hades, makes us see ourselves anew too. <br><br>Margaret Atwood is an astonishing storyteller, and <b>The Penelopiad</b><i> </i>is, most of all, a haunting and deeply entertaining story. This book plumbs murder and memory, guilt and deceit, in a wise and passionate manner. At time hilarious and at times deeply thought-provoking, it is very much a Myth for our times.</p><p><b>Margaret Atwood</b> was born in Ottawa in 1939, and grew up in northern Quebec and Ontario, and later in Toronto.

This is what I wished would happen, but like so many of my wishes it failed to come true. I know only a few factoids that I didn&#x2019;t know before. It&#x2019;s much too high a price to pay for the satisfaction of curiosity, needless to say.<br>Since being dead &#x2014; since achieving this state of bonelessness, liplessness, breastlessness &#x2014; I&#x2019;ve learned some things I would rather not know, as one does when listening at windows or opening other people&#x2019;s letters. You think you&#x2019;d like to read minds? Think again.<br><br>Down here everyone arrives with a sack, like the sacks used to keep the winds in, but each of these sacks is full of words &#x2014; words you&#x2019;ve spoken, words you&#x2019;ve heard, words that have been said about you. Some sacks are very small, others large; my own is of a reasonable size, though a lot of the words in it concern my eminent husband. What a fool he made of me, some say. It was a specialty of his: making fools. He got away with everything, which was another of his specialties: getting away.<br><br>He was always so plausible. Many people have believed that his version of events was the true one, give or take a few murders, a few beautiful seduct�resses, a few one-eyed monsters. Even I believed him, from time to time. I knew he was tricky and a liar, I just didn&#x2019;t think he would play his tricks and try out his lies on me. Hadn&#x2019;t I been faithful? Hadn&#x2019;t I waited, and waited, and waited, despite the temptation &#x2014; almost the compulsion &#x2014; to do otherwise? And what did I amount to, once the official version gained ground? An edifying legend. A stick used to beat other women with. Why couldn&#x2019;t they be as considerate, as trustworthy, as all-suffering as I had been? That was the line they took, the singers, the yarn-spinners. Don&#x2019;t follow my example, I want to scream in your ears &#x2014; yes, yours! But when I try to scream, I sound like an owl.<br><br>Of course I had inklings, about his slipperiness, his wiliness, his foxiness, his &#x2014; how can I put this? &#x2014; his unscrupulousness, but I turned a blind eye. I kept my mouth shut; or, if I opened it, I sang his praises. I didn&#x2019;t contradict, I didn&#x2019;t ask awkward questions, I didn&#x2019;t dig deep. I wanted happy endings in those days, and happy endings are best achieved by keeping the right doors locked and going to sleep during the rampages.<br><br>But after the main events were over and things had become less legendary, I realized how many people were laughing at me behind my back &#x2014; how they were jeering, making jokes about me, jokes both clean and dirty; how they were turning me into a story, or into several stories, though not the kind of stories I&#x2019;d prefer to hear about myself. What can a woman do when scandalous gossip travels the world? If she defends herself she sounds guilty. So I waited some more.<br><br>Now that all the others have run out of air, it&#x2019;s my turn to do a little story-making. I owe it to myself. I&#x2019;ve had to work myself up to it: it&#x2019;s a low art, tale-telling. Old women go in for it, strolling beggars, blind singers, maidservants, children &#x2014; folks with time on their hands. Once, people would have laughed if I&#x2019;d tried to play the minstrel &#x2014; there&#x2019;s nothing more preposterous than an aristocrat fumbling around with the arts &#x2014; but who cares about public opinion now? The opinion of the people down here: the opinion of shadows, of echoes. So I&#x2019;ll spin a thread of my own.<br><br>The difficulty is that I have no mouth through which I can speak. I can&#x2019;t make myself understood, not in your world, the world of bodies, of tongues and fingers; and most of the time I have no listeners, not on your side of the river. Those of you who may catch the odd whisper, the odd squeak, so easily mistake my words for breezes rustling the dry reeds, for bats at twilight, for bad dreams.<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve always been of a determined nature. Patient, they used to call me. I like to see a thing through to the end.<br><br><b>ii</b><br>The Chorus Line:<br>A Rope-Jumping Rhyme<br>we are the maids<br>the ones you killed<br>the ones you failed<br><br>we danced in air<br>our bare feet twitched<br>it was not fair<br><br>with every goddess, queen, and bitch<br>from there to here<br>you scratched your itch<br><br>we did much less<br>than what you did<br>you judged us bad<br><br>you had the spear<br>you had the word<br>at your command<br><br>we scrubbed the blood<br>of our dead<br>paramours from floors, from chairs<br><br>from stairs, from doors,<b><br></b>we knelt in water<br>while you stared<br><br>at our bare feet<b><br></b>it was not fair<br>you licked our fear<br><br>it gave you pleasure<b><br></b>you raised your hand<br>you watched us fall<br><br>we danced on air<b><br></b>the ones you failed<br>the ones you killed<br><br><b>iii<br>My Childhood</b><br>Where shall I begin? There are only two choices: at the beginning or not at the beginning. The real beginning would be the beginning of the world, after which one thing has led to another; but since there are differences of opinion about that, I&#x2019;ll begin with my own birth.<br><br>My father was King Icarius of Sparta. My mother was a Naiad. Daughters of Naiads were a dime a dozen in those days; the place was crawling with them. Nevertheless, it never hurts to be of semi-divine birth. Or it never hurts immediately.<br><br>When I was quite young my father ordered me to be thrown into the sea. I never knew exactly why, during my lifetime, but now I suspect he&#x2019;d been told by an oracle that I would weave his shroud. Possibly he thought that if he killed me first, his shroud would never be woven and he would live forever. I can see how the reasoning might have gone. In that case, his wish to drown me came from an understandable desire to protect himself. But he must have misheard, or else the oracle herself misheard &#x2014; the gods often mumble &#x2014; because it was not his shroud that was at issue, but my father-in-law&#x2019;s shroud. If that was the prophecy it was a true one, and indeed the weaving of this particular shroud proved a great convenience to me later on in my life.<br><br>The teaching of crafts to girls has fallen out of fashion now, I understand, but luckily it had not in my day. It&#x2019;s always an advantage to have something to do with your hands. That way, if someone makes an inappropriate remark, you can pretend you haven&#x2019;t heard it. Then you don&#x2019;t have to answer.<br><br>But perhaps this shroud-weaving oracle idea of mine is baseless. Perhaps I have only invented it in order to make myself feel better.

I. Warshawski series, which began with <i>Indemnity Only</i>. She lives in Chicago.1<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sex and the Single Girl<br> &nbsp;<br> Hot kisses covered my face, dragging me from deep sleep to the rim of consciousness. I groaned and slid deeper under the covers, hoping to sink back into the well of dreams. My companion wasn&#x2019;t in the humor for rest; she burrowed under the blankets and continued to lavish urgent affection on me.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I covered my head with a pillow she started to mew piteously. Now thoroughly awake, I rolled over and glared at her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even five-thirty. You can&#x2019;t possibly want to get up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She paid no attention, either to my words or my efforts to dislodge her from my chest, but looked at me intently, her brown eyes opened wide, her mouth parted slightly to show the tip of her pink tongue.<br> &nbsp;<br> I bared my teeth at her. She licked my nose anxiously. I sat up, pushing her head away from my face. &#x201c;It was this indiscriminate distribution of your kisses that got you into this fix to begin with.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Happy to see me awake, Peppy lumbered down from the bed and headed for the door. She turned to see if I was following, making little whimpering noises in her impatience. I pulled a sweatshirt and shorts from the heap of clothes near the bed and padded on sleep-thickened legs to the back door. I fumbled with the triple locks. By that time Peppy was whimpering in earnest, but she managed to control herself while I got the door open. Breeding shows, I guess.<br> &nbsp;<br> I watched her down the three flights of stairs. Pregnancy had distended her sides and slowed her progress, but she made it to her spot by the back gate before relieving herself. When she was finished she didn&#x2019;t take her usual tour of the yard to drive away cats and other marauders. Instead she waddled back to the stairs. She stopped outside the ground-floor door and let out a sharp bark.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fine. Let Mr. Contreras have her. He was my first-floor neighbor, part owner of the dog, and wholly responsible for her condition. Well, not wholly&#x2014;that had been the work of a black Lab four doors up the street.<br> &nbsp;<br> Peppy had come into season the week I left town on the trail of an industrial sabotage problem. I arranged for a friend of mine, a furniture hauler with steel thews, to run her twice a day&#x2014;on a short leash. When I told Mr. Contreras to expect Tim Streeter he was deeply wounded, although not, unfortunately, beyond words. Peppy was a perfectly trained dog who came when she was called, didn&#x2019;t need to be on a leash; and anyway, who did I think I was, arranging for people to come walk her? If not for him she wouldn&#x2019;t get any care at all, me being gone twenty hours out of twenty-four, I was leaving town, wasn&#x2019;t I? Just another example of my neglect. And besides that, he was fitter than ninety percent of the young jerks I brought around.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a hurry to take off I hadn&#x2019;t heard him out, just agreed that he was in terrific shape for seventy-seven, but asking him to humor me in the matter. It was only ten days later that I learned that Mr. Contreras had dismissed Tim the first time he showed up. The results, if disastrous, were utterly predictable.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man met me dolefully when I returned from Kankakee for the weekend. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know how it happened, doll. She&#x2019;s always so good, always comes when she&#x2019;s called, and this time she just tore away from me and headed down the street. My heart was in my throat, I thought my God, what if she gets hit, what if she gets lost or kidnapped, you know, you read about these labs that hire people to steal dogs off the streets or out of the yard, you never see your dog again and you don&#x2019;t know what happened to her. I was so relieved when I caught up with her, my goodness, what could I ever have said to make you understand&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I snarled unsympathetically. &#x201c;And what are you going to say to me about this business? You haven&#x2019;t wanted to spay her, but you can&#x2019;t control her when she&#x2019;s in season. If you weren&#x2019;t so bullheaded you would&#x2019;ve admitted it and let Tim run her. I&#x2019;ll tell you this much: I&#x2019;m not going to spend my time looking for good homes for her damned offspring.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That brought a spurt of his own temper, which sent him back to his apartment with an angry slam of the door. I avoided him all day Saturday, but I knew we had to make up before I left town again&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t leave him in sole charge of a litter. Anyway, I&#x2019;m too old myself to enjoy bearing a grudge. Sunday morning I went down to patch things up. I even stayed over on Monday so we could go to the vet together.<br> &nbsp;<br> We brought the dog in with the angry tension of the ill-assorted parents of a wayward teenager. The vet cheered me no end by telling me that goldens sometimes have as many as twelve puppies.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But since it&#x2019;s her first litter it probably won&#x2019;t be quite that large,&#x201d; he added with a jolly laugh.<br> &nbsp;<br> I could tell that Mr. Contreras was delighted at the prospect of twelve little black-and-gold fur balls; I did eighty-five all the way back to Kankakee, dragging out my business there as long as possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> That had been two months ago. Now I was more or less resigned to Peppy&#x2019;s fate, but I was much relieved that she seemed to be doing her nesting on the first floor. Mr. Contreras grumbled about the newspapers she shredded in her chosen spot behind his couch, but I knew he would have been unbearably hurt if she&#x2019;d decided her den was in my apartment.<br> &nbsp;<br> This close to her due date she was spending almost all her time inside with him, but yesterday Mr. Contreras had gone to a Las Vegas Night that his old parish was running. He&#x2019;d been involved in the planning for six months and didn&#x2019;t want to miss it, but he called me twice to make sure Peppy hadn&#x2019;t started into labor, and a third time at midnight to check whether I&#x2019;d written down the phone number at the hall they&#x2019;d rented. That third call was what was giving me malicious pleasure at her trying to wake him before six.<br> &nbsp;<br> The June sunshine was bright, but the early morning air was still chilly enough that my bare feet grew too cold to feel the porch floor. I went back inside without waiting for the old man to get up. I could hear Peppy&#x2019;s muffled barks continuing as I kicked my shorts off and stumbled back into bed. My bare leg slid over a wet spot on the sheet. Blood. It couldn&#x2019;t be mine so it had to be the dog&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> I pulled my shorts back on and dialed Mr. Contreras&#x2019;s number. I had my knee socks and running shoes on before he answered, his voice hoarse beyond recognition.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You guys must have had a good old time last night,&#x201d; I said brightly. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;d better get up and face the day&#x2014;you&#x2019;re about to become a grandfather again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d; he rasped. &#x201c;If this is some kind of joke you oughtta know better than to call people at this time of morning and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; I interrupted him. &#x201c;V. I. Warshawski. Your upstairs neighbor, remember? Well, your little dog Peppy has been barking her head off outside your door for the last ten minutes. I believe she wants to come inside and have some puppies.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh. Oh. It&#x2019;s you, doll. What&#x2019;s that about the dog? She&#x2019;s barking at my back door. How long have you left her outside? She shouldn&#x2019;t hang around out there barking when she&#x2019;s this close to her time&#x2014;she could catch a chill, you know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I bit back various sarcastic remarks. &#x201c;I found some blood spots in my bed just now. She may be getting ready to whelp. I&#x2019;ll be right down to help you get things in order.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Contreras started in on a complicated set of instructions about what I should wear. These seemed so pointless that I hung up without ceremony and headed back outside.<br> &nbsp;<br> The vet had stressed that Peppy didn&#x2019;t need any help with her delivery. If we got involved with her while she was in labor or picked up the firstborn puppies it could cause her enough anxiety that she might not be able to handle the rest on her own. I didn&#x2019;t trust Mr. Contreras to remember in the excitement of the moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man was just shutting the back door on Peppy when I got down to the landing. He gave me a harassed look through the glass and disappeared for a minute. When he finally opened the door he held an old workshirt out to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Put this on before you come inside.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I waved the shirt away. &#x201c;This is my old sweatshirt; I&#x2019;m not worried about what I may get on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And I ain&#x2019;t worried about your stupid wardrobe. It&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ve got underneath it I care about. Or what you ain&#x2019;t got underneath it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stared at him, astounded. &#x201c;Since when do I need to put on a bra to look after the dog?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His leathery face turned a dull crimson. The very thought of female undergarments embarrasses him, let alone hearing their names spoken out loud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not because of the dog,&#x201d; he said, agitated. &#x201c;I tried telling you on the phone, but you hung up on me. I know how you like to go traipsing around the house, and it don&#x2019;t bother me any as long as you&#x2019;re decent, which generally speaking you are, but not everybody feels the same way. That&#x2019;s a fact.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think the dog cares?&#x201d; My voice went up half a register. &#x201c;Who the hell else&#x2014;Oh. You brought someone home with you last night from the gambling den. Well, well. Quite an evening for you, huh?&#x201d; Normally I wouldn&#x2019;t be so vulgar about someone&#x2019;s private life, but I felt I owed the old man a lick or two after all the snooping he&#x2019;d done on my male visitors during the last three years.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Standup Guy (A Stone Barrington Novel)</h2><p><b>Stone Barrington is back in the newest edge-of-your-seat adventure in the <i>New York Times&#x2013;</i>bestselling series.</b><br><br>Stone Barrington&#x2019;s newest client does not seem the type to bring mayhem in his wake.

Any friend of Eduardo Bianci&#x2019;s was a friend of his.</p><p>A vision of the mid-to-late twentieth century appeared in the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Barrington? May I come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Stone said, rising to greet his visitor, who was wearing a boxy, light gray flannel suit, a starched white shirt, and what appeared to be a clip-on bow tie. He was carrying a salesman&#x2019;s suitcase and a porkpie hat and had a haircut that had probably been accomplished entirely with electric clippers&#x2014;short sides and a Brylcreemed top. &#x201c;Come in and have a seat, Mr. Fratelli.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice of you to see me.&#x201d; This was delivered in what appeared to be an old-fashioned Brooklyn accent, the likes of which had not been heard for many years from a man as young as Fratelli, who appeared to be no older than fifty. He came in and took the proffered chair across the desk and set down the suitcase.</p><p>&#x201c;How may I help you?&#x201d; Stone said, hoping the man was not a salesman.</p><p>Fratelli stood again, reached into a pocket, and pulled out a wad of bills; he peeled off five hundreds and placed them carefully on Stone&#x2019;s desk.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve paid for a consultation and bought yourself some attorney-client confidentiality.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Fratelli said, sitting down again.</p><p>&#x201c;I should inform you, though, that if you confess to a crime and I end up representing you in court, I will not be able to call you to the stand to testify on your own behalf.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Fratelli inquired.</p><p>&#x201c;Because I cannot call a witness to the stand who I know will lie under oath.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Fratelli said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s reasonable, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How is Mr. Bianci?&#x201d; Stone asked, by way of getting the man to relax.</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you not tell my secretary that Eduardo had sent you to me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I meant Eduardo Buono.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not Bianci?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Buono.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anyone by that name,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he knows you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How does he know me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He read an article about you in a magazine&#x2014;Vanity Fair.&#x201d;</p><p>That magazine had published an excerpt from a book about Stone&#x2019;s late wife, Arrington. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eduardo says you&#x2019;re a standup guy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, as kind a characterization as that may be&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eduardo and I shared a living space for twenty-two years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy for you both, but that still doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eduardo was a very smart man, even if he did get caught.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ahhhh,&#x201d; Stone said. Now he understood. &#x201c;Where did you do your time, Mr. Fratelli?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sing Sing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And when did you get out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How long were you away?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-five years, to the day. I did my whole sentence, no parole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was the rap?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Armed robbery. I did it, no excuses. That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t apply for parole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you, not I, are the standup guy, Mr. Fratelli.&#x201d;</p><p>Fratelli actually blushed. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said softly.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, please tell me, how can I help you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eduardo left me two million dollars,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations, but if you&#x2019;re looking for investment advice, I&#x2019;m not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for advice on how not to go back to prison,&#x201d; Fratelli said.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fairly simple, Mr. Fratelli&#x2014;don&#x2019;t commit another crime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sure, but&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I think I see. Did Mr. Buono acquire your inheritance by extralegal means?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he rob somebody?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly, but Eduardo said the statue was done.&#x201d;</p><p>That stopped Stone in his tracks for a moment, then he figured it out. &#x201c;Do you mean the statute? The statute of limitations?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, the statute of limitations for robbery is five years, so if you and Mr. Buono were cellmates for twenty-two years . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s mine, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t go as far as that,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s problematical.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was afraid you&#x2019;d say something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Fratelli, let me put this hypothetically, since you and I do not want to discuss a real crime.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I get that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If prisoner A committed a crime, and the statute of limitations has run out, then he can mention prisoner B in his will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t exactly like that,&#x201d; Fratelli said. &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;I mean, in this story prisoner A didn&#x2019;t have a will, he had a safe-deposit box. He, hypothetically speaking, had a bank account, and every quarter for twenty-five years, the bank deducted the rental of the safe-deposit box from his account. From time to time, his lawyer deposited funds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And prisoner B has access to the box?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Prisoner A told me&#x2014;ah, him&#x2014;where to find the key.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And has prisoner B visited the box?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could say that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And he emptied the box?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About an hour ago,&#x201d; Fratelli said. &#x201c;Just as soon as the bank opened, prisoner B was there with the key.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did anyone see what he removed from the box?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he was in a little closet, and he had brought a suitcase. He just walked out with the money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His question is, what&#x2019;s he going to do with it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever he likes,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;As long as no one knows he has it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does prisoner B have the money legally?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A better question might be, is anyone going to be looking for the money? A widow? A nephew? A bookie?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have any of those, and nobody knows about the money. Hypothetically.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How about the lawyer who made the bank deposits?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He died three weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then, Mr. Fratelli, prisoner B is laughing.&#x201d;</p><p>Fratelli laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;His first move should be to go to a bank&#x2014;a different bank&#x2014;open a checking account with less than ten thousand dollars, then rent another safe-deposit box. After that, he could remove enough money periodically to support himself. Lashing out with large amounts could get him into trouble, as you might imagine. People will steal, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, they will,&#x201d; Fratelli said.</p><p>&#x201c;Ten thousand dollars is the magic number. If prisoner B banks that much, a form reporting it goes to the Internal Revenue Service, and, although they are said to have stacks of those forms, which they never read, it&#x2019;s not a good idea to generate such a form. After all, they may start reading faster, or they may teach a computer how to read them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good advice,&#x201d; Fratelli said.</p><p>&#x201c;One other thing: if you should seek legal advice again, it might be in your interests to go to an attorney who has not heard this hypothetical story.&#x201d;</p><p>Fratelli stood up. &#x201c;Thank you, Mr. Barrington,&#x201d; he said, offering his hand.</p><p>They shook, Fratelli left, and Stone opened a desk drawer and raked the little stack of hundreds into it.</p><p>Joan came in a moment later. &#x201c;While you were talking to Mr. Fratelli, a secretary to the president of the United States called. You&#x2019;re invited to dinner tomorrow evening with President and Mrs. Lee at their apartment in the Carlyle.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone had not heard from the Lees in months. &#x201c;Call back and say that I accept, with pleasure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You may bring a date.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s current squeeze, the fashion designer Emma Tweed, had returned to her native London for a few weeks. &#x201c;Say that I will come alone.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Stone wore a dark suit and a tie, because he didn&#x2019;t know who else was invited. He entered the Carlyle Hotel and got off the elevator at the penthouse level, where he was greeted by two Secret Service agents to whom he identified himself. That wasn&#x2019;t good enough; they went over him with the wand.</p><p>Katherine Rule Lee, now retired as director of Central Intelligence, answered the door. She was wearing tight jeans and a sweater, and she looked good in both. &#x201c;Oh, Stone,&#x201d; she said, offering both cheeks to be kissed and giving him a hug, &#x201c;nobody told you to dress down?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get that part of the message,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m not in the least uncomfortable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will&#x2019;s watching the news. Knob Creek?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d;</p><p>She pointed him at the living room, then went to the bar, while he continued.</p><p>Will Lee stood up and offered his hand. &#x201c;Good to see you, Stone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you, Mr. President.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still Will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good to see you, Will.&#x201d;</p><p>The president waved him to a chair, and Kate brought him his drink.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re showing excerpts from last night&#x2019;s Democratic campaign debate,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>The three of them watched in silence until the program ended, then Will turned off the TV. &#x201c;What did you think?&#x201d; he asked Stone.</p><p>&#x201c;I think there are at least three guys and one woman in that field who would make a good president.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not one who could win against Taft Duncan,&#x201d; Stone said, referring to the Speaker of the House and presumptive Republican nominee.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I agree,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;What have you been up to Stone?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just come back from Los Angeles, where my son, Peter, who recently graduated from Yale, has established himself on the Centurion Studios lot as a director. Dino&#x2019;s son, Ben, is his partner, and Peter&#x2019;s girlfriend, Hattie Patrick, writes the music for their films.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met them all, last year at the opening of The Arrington,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;Remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How could I forget?&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>They all shared a laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;And what does the next year hold for you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My year seems oddly empty, with Peter on the other side of the country, so I guess I&#x2019;ll have to think about practicing some law. Bill Eggers is making broad hints about my absences from the firm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, yes, the partners won&#x2019;t want to share income with one of their number who is an absentee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I have made a lot of rain,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;so I don&#x2019;t think I have to worry about them ganging up on me. What brings you to town?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, Kate is supposed to have an informal meeting with the board of Strategic Services tomorrow evening.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know, I&#x2019;ll be at the dinner.&#x201d; Kate had been invited to join the board of directors after Will left office.</p><p>&#x201c;Our other reason for being here is to see you,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>That puzzled Stone. &#x201c;Oh?&#x201d;</p><p>A man in a white jacket appeared and announced dinner, so they all went to a table with a spectacular view of the New York City skyline. Stone took a sip of his wine and waited for the president to finish his thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Stone,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;the day before yesterday I received a bundle of twenty letters, each of them written by a Democratic Party bigwig or a major campaign contributor, all individually composed but with the same subject. Can you guess what that subject was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it seems a little late in the game to get a constitutional amendment passed that would allow you to run for a third term.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God for that,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;What they wanted was what they see as the next best thing.&#x201d; He sat silently and waited for the penny to drop.</p><p>It took Stone a moment. &#x201c;Kate,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;They want Kate to run.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Terrible idea, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Kate said. She had been quiet until now.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a terrific idea,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;But we&#x2019;re halfway through the primaries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My very point,&#x201d; Kate said, &#x201c;but Will doesn&#x2019;t think that is an impediment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I think Stone can figure out why,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>&#x201c;Because it looks like none of the candidates is going to have anything like a majority of the delegates going into the first ballot at the convention.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, for the first time in I-don&#x2019;t-know-how-long, we&#x2019;d have a brokered convention?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since 1952,&#x201d; Will said, &#x201c;when Adlai Stevenson got the nomination. We&#x2019;ve had some close brushes since, but not the real thing. The primary process usually works to nominate a candidate.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone thought about that. &#x201c;I was just thinking about Gore Vidal&#x2019;s play The Best Man, which dealt with that subject.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you remember what each candidate needed to get the nomination?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, the support of an earlier president, a Trumanesque figure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think Kate would have any trouble getting the support of the sitting president, would she?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to get him to withhold that support,&#x201d; Kate said.</p><p>&#x201c;Actually, she doesn&#x2019;t have to try,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;It would be politically impossible for me to support her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Republicans would say you&#x2019;re trying to create a dynasty,&#x201d; Stone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not just the Republicans,&#x201d; Will replied. &#x201c;A lot of Democrats, too, especially the three or four leading candidates.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;d have to sit back, clam up, and wait for the convention to sort it out&#x2014;after the first ballot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Will said.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really think anybody&#x2019;s going to buy that, do you?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not. All the commentators and not a few of the delegates will say I&#x2019;m pulling all the strings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how would you handle that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By not pulling any strings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean you&#x2019;d actually sit out the nomination without showing the slightest support for Kate?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not so much as a nod or a wink,&#x201d; Will replied. &#x201c;And not a word of advice to her or any of her supporters on obtaining the nomination. If she gets it, then I&#x2019;ll shoot my mouth off at every opportunity, of course, but after tonight, I won&#x2019;t say a word to her or anyone else on the subject, except &#x2018;no comment.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You see how crazy this is?&#x201d; Kate said.</p><p>&#x201c;Kate,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;let me ask you a question: do you think you&#x2019;d make a good president?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d make a sensational president,&#x201d; Kate said.</p><p>Stone turned to Will. &#x201c;And, Will, do you think she can beat Taft Duncan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In my last word on the subject, yes,&#x201d; Will said. He looked at his watch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better hurry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sneaking into the Blue Note to hear Chris Botti&#x2019;s last set.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I come with you?&#x201d; Stone asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big Chris Botti fan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you have a meeting to attend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What meeting is that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In about an hour the twenty people who wrote me those letters are arriving here for a drink with Kate, so I can&#x2019;t be here. But you can.&#x201d;</p><p>Will got up and shook Stone&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Hope to see you soon, Stone, but when I do, I don&#x2019;t want to hear a word about Kate&#x2019;s plans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gotcha, Will.&#x201d; He and Kate watched him disappear out the door, two Secret Service agents close behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Kate said, heaving a sigh. &#x201c;Now I have only you to help me greet the throng.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you going to say to them?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s better if you hear it at the same time they do,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I have to get into something more presidential.&#x201d; She got up and left Stone to contemplate his dessert.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>Kate came back at five minutes before the hour and handed Stone a sheet of paper. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the list of the invitees. The good news is, every one of them accepted.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone scanned the list quickly. &#x201c;This is a great tribute to you,&#x201d; he said.

He was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize in 2006. His work has been translated into more than forty languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Auster's ( Moon Palace ; the New York Trilogy) offbeat and strangely compelling black comedy invites speculation about the counterpointing of choice and chance, and carries resonances of Samuel Beckett. With a windfall of nearly $200,000, Jim Nashe abandons his stalled life, leaves his small daughter Juliette with Minnesota relatives and compulsively drives around the country for a year. He meets a frail, spunky, badly beaten youngster, self-advertised jackpot winner Jack Pozzi, and agrees to finance Pozzi in an epic poker match against an apparently childlike but actually malign pair named Flower and Stone in their remote mansion. Ruined in the game, Nashe and Pozzi try to work off their huge debt by building a wall out of 10,000 stones from an imported Irish castle, under the baleful overseer Murks, who gets Nashe's prized car. Affection springs up between Nashe and "the kid," Pozzi, but optimism erodes as their plight becomes clear, disaster befalls Pozzi and numbing toil stretches endlessly. In his lucid, captivating yarn, Auster quietly raises disturbing questions of servants and masters, of loyalty, freedom and the inexplicable urge to kill. 25,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Transparent Watercolor Wheel: A Logical and Easy-to-use System for Taking the Guesswork out of Mixing Colours</h2><p>With its unique fold-out color wheel, this book takes the guesswork out of mixing watercolors.

He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.After three fine collections celebrating SF greats Arthur C. Clarke, Fritz Leiber and Philip Jose Farmer, Preiss's Masterworks of SF &amp; Fantasy series hits a snag here. Herbert is one of the biggest names in the field but his best work has been of novel length (Dune, Hellstrom's Hive, etc.). While some of the themes of those books reappear here, the stories are generally mediocre because Herbert lacks the space for adequate background and characterization to make us care.

In this tour de force of political, cultural and economic history, Felix Martin challenges nothing less than our conventional understanding of money. He describes how the Western idea of money emerged from interactions between Mesopotamia and ancient Greece and was shaped over the centuries by tensions between sovereigns and the emerging middle classes. He explores the extraordinary diversity of the world&#x2019;s monetary systems, from the Pacific island of Yap, where value was once measured by immovable stones, to the currency of today that exists solely on globally connected computer screens. Martin shows that money has always been a deeply political instrument, and that it is our failure to remember this that led to the crisis in our financial system and so to the Great Recession. He concludes with practical solutions to our current pressing, money-based problems. <br><br><i>Money </i>skips nimbly among such far-ranging topics as John Locke&#x2019;s disastrous excursion into economic policy, Montesquieu&#x2019;s faith in finance to discipline the power of kings, the social organization of ancient Sparta and the Soviet Union&#x2019;s ill-fated attempt to abolish money and banking altogether. Throughout, Martin makes vivid sense of a chaotic and sometimes incoherent system&#x2014;the everyday currency that we all share&#x2014;in the clearest and most stimulating terms. This is a magisterial work of history and economics, with profound implications for the world today.</p></p><p>Felix Martin was educated in Britain, Italy and the United States and holds degrees in classics, international relations and economics, including a doctorate in economics from Oxford University.&nbsp; He worked for the World Bank and for the European Stability Initiative think tank, and is currently a partner in the fixed income division at Liontrust Asset Management plc.&nbsp; He lives in London.<i>Excerpted from the Hardcover edition</i><br>1 What Is Money?<br><br>Everyone, except an economist, knows what &#x201c;money&#x201d; means, and even an economist can describe it in the course of a chapter or so . . .<br>&#x2014;A.H. Quiggin, A Survey of Primitive Money: the Beginnings of Currency, p. 1<br>the island of stone money<br><br>The Pacific island of Yap was, at the beginning of the twentieth century, one of the most remote and inaccessible inhabited places on earth. An idyllic, subtropical paradise, nestled in a tiny archipelago nine degrees north of the equator and more than 300 miles from Palau, its closest neighbour, Yap had remained almost innocent of the world beyond Micronesia right up until the final decades of the nineteenth century. There had, it is true, been a brief moment of Western contact in 1731 when a group of intrepid Catholic missionaries had established a small base on the island. When their supply ship returned the following year, however, it discovered that the balmy, palm-scattered islands of Yap had not proved fertile ground for the Christian gospel. The entire mission had been mas�sacred several months previously by local witch doctors aggrieved at the competition presented by the Good News. Yap was left to its own devices for another one hundred and forty years.<br>It was not until 1869 that the first European trading post&#x2014;run by the German merchant firm of Godeffroy and sons&#x2014;was established in the Yap archipelago. Once a few years had passed, with Godeffroy not only avoiding summary execution but prospering, Yap&#x2019;s presence came to the attention of the Spanish, who by virtue of their colonial possessions in the Philippines&#x2014;a mere 800 miles to the west&#x2014;considered themselves the natural overlords of this part of Micronesia. The Spanish laid claim to the islands, and believed that they had achieved a fait accompli when in the summer of 1885 they erected a house and installed a Governor in it. They had not counted, however, on the tenacity of Bismarck&#x2019;s Germany in matters of foreign policy. No island was so small, or so remote, as to be unworthy of the Imperial Foreign Ministry&#x2019;s attention if it meant a potential addition to German power. The ownership of Yap became the subject of an international dispute. Eventually, the matter was referred&#x2014;somewhat ironically, given the island&#x2019;s track record&#x2014;to arbitration by the Pope, who granted political control to Spain, but full commercial rights to Germany. But the Iron Chancellor had the last laugh. Within a decade and a half, Spain had lost a damaging war with America, and its ambitions in the Pacific had disintegrated. In 1899, Spain sold Yap to Germany for the sum of $3.3 million.<br>The absorption of Yap into the German Empire had one great benefit. It brought one of the more interesting and unusual monetary systems in history to the attention of the world. More specifically, it proved the catalyst for a visit by a brilliant and eccentric young American adventurer, William Henry Furness III. The scion of a prominent New England family, Furness had trained as a doctor before converting to anthropology and making his name with a popular account of his travels in Borneo. In 1903 he made a two-month visit to Yap, and published a broad survey of its physical and social make-up a few years later.1 He was immediately impressed by how much more remote and untouched it was than Borneo. Yet despite being a tiny island with only a few thousand inhabitants&#x2014;&#x201c;whose whole length and breadth is but a day&#x2019;s walk,&#x201d; as Furness described it&#x2014;Yap turned out to have a remarkably complex society. There was a caste system, with a tribe of slaves, and special clubhouses lived in by fishing and fighting fraternities. There was a rich tradition of dancing and songs, which Furness took particular delight in recording for posterity. There was a vibrant native religion&#x2014;as the missionaries had previously discovered to their cost&#x2014;complete with an elaborate genesis myth locating the origins of the Yapese in a giant barnacle attached to some floating driftwood. But undoubtedly the most striking thing that Furness discovered on Yap was its monetary system.<br>The economy of Yap, such as it was, could hardly be called developed. The market extended to a bare three products&#x2014;fish, coconuts, and Yap&#x2019;s one and only luxury, sea cucumber. There was no other exchangeable commodity to speak of; no agriculture; few arts and crafts; the only domesticated animals were pigs and, since the Germans had arrived, a few cats; and there had been little contact or trade with outsiders. It was as simple and as isolated an economy as one could hope to find. Given these antediluvian conditions, Furness expected to find nothing more advanced than simple barter. Indeed, as he observed, &#x201c;in a land where food and drink and ready-made clothes grow on trees and may be had for the gathering&#x201d; it seemed possible that even barter itself would be an unnecessary sophistication.<br>The very opposite turned out to be true. Yap had a highly developed system of money. It was impossible for Furness not to notice it the moment that he set foot on the island, because its coinage was extremely unusual. It consisted of fei&#x2014;&#x201c;large, solid, thick stone wheels ranging in diameter from a foot to twelve feet, having in the centre a hole varying in size with the diameter of the stone, wherein a pole may be inserted sufficiently large and strong to bear the weight and facilitate transportation.&#x201d; This stone money was originally quarried on Babelthuap, an island some 300 miles away in Palau, and had mostly been brought to Yap, so it was said, long ago. The value of the coins depended principally on their size, but also on the fineness of the grain and the whiteness of the limestone.<br>At first, Furness believed that this bizarre form of currency might have been chosen because, rather than in spite, of its extraordinary unwieldiness: &#x201c;when it takes four strong men to steal the price of a pig, burglary cannot but prove a somewhat disheartening occupation,&#x201d; he ventured. &#x201c;As may be supposed, thefts of fei are almost unknown.&#x201d; But as time went on, he observed that physical transportation of fei from one house to another was in fact rare. Numerous transactions took place&#x2014;but the debts incurred were typically just offset against each other, with any outstanding balance carried forward in expectation of some future exchange. Even when open balances were felt to require settlement, it was not usual for fei to be physically exchanged. &#x201c;The noteworthy feature of this stone currency,&#x201d; wrote Furness, &#x201c;is that it is not necessary for its owner to reduce it to possession. After concluding a bargain which involves the price of a fei too large to be conveniently moved, its new owner is quite content to accept the bare acknowledgement of ownership and without so much as a mark to indicate the exchange, the coin remains undisturbed on the former owner&#x2019;s premises.&#x201d;<br>When Furness expressed amazement at this aspect of the Yap monetary system, his guide told him an even more surprising story:<br>[T]here was in the village near by a family whose wealth was unquestioned&#x2014;acknowledged by everyone&#x2014;and yet no one, not even the family itself, had ever laid eye or hand on this wealth; it consisted of an enormous fei, whereof the size is known only by tradition; for the past two or three generations it had been and was at that time lying at the bottom of the sea!<br>This fei, it transpired, had been shipwrecked during a storm while in transit from Babelthuap many years ago. Nevertheless:<br>[I]t was universally conceded . . . that the mere accident of its loss overboard was too trifling to mention, and that a few hundred feet of water off shore ought not to affect its marketable value . . .&nbsp;<br>The purchasing power of that stone remains, therefore, as valid as if it were leaning visibly against the side of the owner&#x2019;s house, and represents wealth as potentially as the hoarded inactive gold of a miser in the Middle Ages, or as our silver dollars stacked in the Treasury in Washington, which we never see or touch, but trade with on the strength of a printed certificate that they are there.<br>When it was published in 1910, it seemed unlikely that Furness&#x2019; &nbsp;eccentric travelogue would ever reach the notice of the economics profession. But eventually a copy happened to find its way to the editors of the Royal Economic Society&#x2019;s Economic Journal, who assigned the book to a young Cambridge economist, recently seconded to the British Treasury on war duty: a certain John Maynard Keynes. The man who over the next twenty years was to revolutionise the world&#x2019;s understanding of money and finance was astonished. Furness&#x2019; book, he wrote, &#x201c;has brought us into contact with a people whose ideas on currency are probably more truly philosophical than those of any other country. Modern practice in regard to gold reserves has a good deal to learn from the more logical practices of the island of Yap.&#x201d; Why it was that the greatest economist of the twentieth century believed the monetary system of Yap to hold such important and universal lessons is the subject of this book.<br>great minds think alike<br>What is money, and where does it come from?<br>A few years ago, over a drink, I posed these two questions to an old friend&#x2014;a successful entrepreneur with a prospering business in the financial services industry. He responded with a familiar story. In primitive times, there was no money&#x2014;just barter. When people needed something that they didn&#x2019;t produce themselves, they had to find someone who had it and was willing to swap it for whatever they did produce. Of course, the problem with this system of barter exchange is that it was very inefficient. You had to find another person who had exactly what you wanted, and who in turn wanted exactly what you had got&#x2014;and what is more, both at exactly the same time. So at a certain point, the idea emerged of choosing one thing to serve as a &#x201c;medium of exchange.&#x201d; This thing could in principle be anything&#x2014;so long as, by general agreement, it was universally acceptable as payment. In practice, however, gold and silver have always been the most common choices, because they are durable, malleable, portable, and rare. In any case, whatever it was, this thing was from then on desirable not only for its own sake, but because it could be used to buy other things and to store up wealth for the future. This thing, in short, was money&#x2014;and this is where money came from.<br>It&#x2019;s a simple and powerful story. And as I explained to my friend, it is a theory of money&#x2019;s nature and origins with a very ancient and distinguished pedigree. A version of it can be found in Aristotle&#x2019;s Politics, the earliest treatment of the subject in the entire Western canon. It is the theory developed by John Locke, the father of classical political Liberalism, in his Second Treatise of Government. To cap it all, it is the very theory&#x2014;almost to the letter&#x2014;advocated by none other than Adam Smith in his chapter &#x201c;Of the Origin and Use of Money&#x201d; in the foundation text of modern economics, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations:<br>But when the division of labour first began to take place, this power of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in its operations . . . The butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume, and the brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of it. But they have nothing to offer in exchange, except the productions of their respective trades, and the butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for . . . In order to avoid such situations, every prudent man in every period of society, after the first establishment of the division of labour, must naturally have endeavoured to manage his affairs in such a manner, as to have at all times by him, besides the peculiar produce of his own industry, a certain quantity of some one commodity or other, such as he imagined few other people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry.<br>Smith even shared my friend&#x2019;s agnosticism as to which commodity would be chosen to serve as money:<br>Many different commodities, it is probable, were successively both thought of and employed for this purpose. In the rude ages of society, cattle are said to have been the most common instrument of commerce . . . Salt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchange in Abyssinia; a species of shells in some parts of the coast of India; dried cod in Newfoundland; tobacco in Virginia; sugar in some of our West India colonies; hides or dressed leather in some other countries; and there is to this day a village in Scotland where it is not uncommon, I am told, for a workman to carry nails instead of money to the baker&#x2019;s shop or the alehouse.<br>And like my friend, Smith also believed that in general, gold, silver, and other metals were the most logical choices:<br>In all countries, however, men seem at last to have been determined by irresistible reasons to give the preference, for this employment, to metals above every other commodity. Metals can not only be kept with as little loss as any other commodity, scarce any thing being less perishable than they are, but they can likewise, without any loss, be divided into any number of parts, as by fusion of those parts can easily be re-united again; a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess, and which more than any other quality renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation.<br>So I told my friend he could congratulate himself. Without having studied economics at all, he had arrived at the same theory as the great Adam Smith. But that&#x2019;s not all, I explained. This theory of money&#x2019;s origins and nature is not just a historical curiosity like Ptolemy&#x2019;s geocentric astronomy&#x2014;a set of obsolete hypotheses long since superseded by more modern theories. On the contrary, it is found today in virtually all mainstream textbooks of economics.14 What&#x2019;s more, its fundamental ideas have formed the bedrock of an immense body of detailed theoretical and empirical research on monetary questions over the last sixty years. Based on its assumptions, economists have designed sophisticated mathematical models to explore exactly why one commodity is chosen as money over all others and how much of it people will want to hold, and have constructed a vast analytical apparatus designed to explain every aspect of money&#x2019;s value and use. It has provided the basis for the branch of economics&#x2014;&#x201c;macroeconomics&#x201d; as it is known&#x2014;which seeks to explain economic booms and busts, and to recommend how we can moderate these so-called business cycles by managing interest rates and government spending. In short, my friend&#x2019;s ideas not only had history behind them. They remain today, amongst amateurs and experts alike, very much the conventional theory of money.</p><h2>Rolling Stone 1,000 Covers: A History of the Most Influential Magazine in Pop Culture</h2><p>For the past 39 years, the covers of <i>Rolling Stone</i> have depicted the great icons of popular culture, from John Lennon, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, and Madonna to Steve Martin, Uma Thurman, and Richard Nixon.

We can write a check to feed starving children or hold signs in the streets and feel like we&#x2019;ve made a difference without ever encountering the faces of the suffering masses. In this book, Shane Claiborne describes an authentic faith rooted in belief, action, and love, inviting us into a movement of the Spirit that begins inside each of us and extends into a broken world. Shane&#x2019;s faith led him to dress the wounds of lepers with Mother Teresa, visit families in Iraq amidst bombings, and dump $10,000 in coins and bills on Wall Street to redistribute wealth. Shane lives out this revolution each day in his local neighborhood, an impoverished community in North Philadelphia, by living among the homeless, helping local kids with homework, and &#x201c;practicing resurrection&#x201d; in the forgotten places of our world. Shane&#x2019;s message will comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable . . . but will also invite us into an irresistible revolution.

Interior design by Michelle Espinoza Printed in the United States of America It&#39;s what always happens to the saints and prophets who are dangerous: we bronze them, we drain them of their passion and life and trap them in stained-glass windows and icons, confining them safely in memories of the past. St. Francis becomes a birdbath, Malcolm X is put on a stamp, and Martin Luther King gets a holiday. And Jesus gets commercialized, whether it&#39;s the plastic night-lights or the golden crucifixes. (And now there is a bobbing-head &#39;Buddy Jesus&#39; for your car and the &#39;Jesus is my homeboy&#39; T-shirt.) It becomes hard to know who Jesus really is, much less to imagine that Jesus ever laughed, cried, or had poop that smelled. I can remember when Christianity was still safe, comfortable, trendy. I grew up in the Bible Belt, in East Tennessee, where there&#39;s a church building on nearly every corner. I can&#39;t remember meeting anyone Jewish or Muslim, and I distinctly remember being dissuaded from dating a Catholic girl because she &#39;prayed to Mary.&#39; I attended two or three different youth groups, whichever had the best entertainment and drew the largest crowd. Church was a place where there were cute girls, free junk food, and cheap snowboarding trips. I discovered a Chris�tianity that entertained me with quirky songs and velcro walls.1 In middle school, I had a sincere &#39;conversion&#39; experience. We took a trip to a large Christian festival with bands, speakers, and late-night pranks. One night a short, bald preacherman named Duffy Robbins gave an invitation to &#39;accept Jesus,&#39; and nearly our whole youth group went forward (a new concept for most of us), crying and snotting, hugging people we didn&#39;t know. I was born again. The next year, we went to that same festival, and most of us went forward again (it was so good the first time) and got born again, again. In fact, we looked forward to it every year. I must have gotten born again six or eight times, and it was great every time. (I highly recommend it.) But then you start to think there must be more to Christianity, more than just laying your life and sins at the foot of the cross. I came to realize that preachers were telling me to lay my life at the foot of the cross and weren&#39;t giving me anything to pick up. A lot of us were hearing &#39;don&#39;t smoke, don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t sleep around&#39; and naturally started asking, &#39;Okay, well, that was pretty much my life, so what do I do now?&#39; Where were the do&#39;s? And nobody seemed to have much to offer us. Handing out tracts at the mall just didn&#39;t seem like the fullness of Chris�tian discipleship, not to mention it just wasn&#39;t as fun as making out at the movies. I was just another believer. I believed all the right stuff --- that Jesus is the Son of God, died and rose again. I had become a &#39;believer,&#39; but I had no idea what it means to be a follower. People had taught me what Chris�tians believe, but no one had told me how Chris�tians live. So as we do in our culture, I thought perhaps I needed to buy more stuff, Chris�tian stuff. Luckily, I found an entire Chris�tian industrial complex ready to help with Chris�tian music, bumper stickers, T-shirts, books, and even candy (&#39;Testamints&#39; . . . dead serious . . . mints with a Bible verse attached, candy with a Chris�tian aftertaste). They had lists of bands and the Chris�tian alternatives to them, so I got rid of all my old CDs. (And I must confess, I was a bit disappointed by the Chris�tian counterfeit. Who could compare to Guns N&#39; Roses and Vanilla Ice?)</p><h2>Extreme Alpinism: Climbing Light, High, and Fast</h2><p><b>1999 Banff Mountain Exposition Award Winner</b><br> <ul> <li>The book that launched a renaissance in climbing technique and remains relevant today</li> <li>Techniques and mental skills needed to climb at a more challenging level</li> <li>Illustrated with full-color photos throughout</li> </ul> Big, high routes at the edge of a climber's ability are not the places for inventing technique or relying on old habits.

Visit her website at www.SusanWiggs.com.Jenny Majesky pushed away from her writing desk and stretched, massaging an ache in the small of her back. Something perhaps the profound silence of the empty house had awakened her at three in the morning, and she hadn't been able to get back to sleep. She'd worked on her newspaper column for a while, hunched over her laptop in a ratty robe and fuzzy slippers. At the moment, though, she was no better at writing than she was at sleeping.<p> </p><p>There was so much she wanted to say, so many stories to put down, but how could she cram the memories and kitchen wisdom of a lifetime into a weekly column?</p><p> </p><p>Then again, she'd always wanted to write more than a column. Much more. The universe, she realized, was taking away all her excuses. She really ought to get started writing that book.</p><p> </p><p>Like any good writer, Jenny procrastinated. Idly, she picked up her grandmother's wedding band, which had been lying in a small china dish on the desk. She hadn't quite decided what to do with it, a plain circle of gold that Helen Majesky had worn for fifty years of marriage and another decade of widowhood. When she baked, Gram always slipped the ring into the pocket of her apron. It was a wonder she never lost it. She'd made Jenny promise not to bury her with it, though.</p><p> </p><p>Twirling the ring around the tip of her forefinger, Jenny could picture her grandmother's hands, strong and firm as they worked a mound of dough, or gentle and light as they caressed her granddaughter's cheek or checked her forehead for fever.</p><p> </p><p>Jenny slid the ring onto her finger and closed her hand into a fist. She had a wedding ring of her own, given and received with a sense of giddy hope but never worn. It now resided in a bottom drawer she never opened.</p><p> </p><p>It was hard, at this velvet-black hour, not to tally up her losses her mother, who had walked away when Jenny was small. Then Jenny's grandfather, and finally, and perhaps most importantly, Gram.</p><p> </p><p>Only a few weeks had passed since she'd laid her grandmother to rest. After the initial flurry of sympathy calls and visits, a lull had settled in, and Jenny felt it in her bones she was truly alone. Yes, she had caring friends and coworkers who were as dear to her as family. But now the steady presence of her grandmother, who had raised her like a daughter, was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Out of habit, she saved her work on the laptop. Then she wrapped her robe more snugly around her and went to the window, pressing close to the cold glass to look out at the deep winter night. Snow erased all the sharp edges and colors of the landscape. In the middle of the night, Maple Street was entirely deserted, washed in the gray-white glow of a single street lamp in the middle of the block. Jenny had lived here all her life; she'd stood countless times at this very spot, expecting�&#x20ac;�what? For something to change. To begin.</p><p> </p><p>She gave a restless sigh, her breath misting the window. The snow flurries had thickened to flakes, swirling in a blur around the streetlight. Jenny loved the snow; she always had. Staring out at the blanketed landscape, she could easily picture herself as a child, hiking with her grandfather to the sledding hill. She used to literally follow in his footsteps, leaping from one hollowedout bootprint to the next, pulling the Flexible Flyer on a rope behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Her grandparents had been there for all the moments of her childhood. Now that they were gone, there was no one to hold the memories, to look at her and say, "Remember the time you�&#x20ac;�"</p><p> </p><p>Her mother had left when Jenny was four, and her father was a virtual stranger she'd met only six months ago. Jenny considered this a blessing in disguise. From what she knew of her biological parents, neither had been as well-equipped to raise a child as Helen and Leo Majesky.</p><p> </p><p>A noise a thud and then a scratching sound made her jump, startling her from her thoughts. She cocked her head, listening, then decided it had been thick snow or a row of icicles, falling from the roof. You never knew how quiet a house could be until you were totally alone in it.</p><p> </p><p>Since her grandmother had died, Jenny had been waking up in the middle of the night, her mind full of memories begging to be written down. All of them seemed to emanate, like the smells of baking, from her grandmother's kitchen. Jenny had kept a diary or journal nearly all her life, and over the past few years, her habit had evolved into a regular column for the <i>Avalon Troubadour, </i>a mingling of recipes, kitchen lore and anecdotes. Since Gram's passing, Jenny could no longer check a fact with her, or pick her brain about the origin of a certain ingredient or baking technique. Jenny was on her own now, and she was afraid that if she waited too long, she'd forget things.</p><p> </p><p>The thought stirred her into action. She'd been meaning to transcribe her grandmother's ancient recipes, some of them still in the original Polish, written on brittle, yellowed paper. The recipes were stored in the pantry in a latched tin box that hadn't been opened in years. Ignoring the fact that it was now three-thirty in the morning, Jenny headed downstairs. When she stepped into the pantry, she was struck by an achingly familiar smell her grandmother's spices and the aroma of flour and grain. She stood on tiptoe to reach the old metal box. Sliding it off the shelf, she lost her balance and dropped the thing, its contents exploding at her fuzzy-slippered feet.</p><p> </p><p>She uttered a word she never would have said when Gram was alive, tiptoeing gingerly as she tried not to step on any of the fragile old documents. Now she would need a flashlight, because the dark pantry didn't have a light. She found a flashlight in a utility drawer but its batteries were dead and there wasn't another fresh battery in the house. She considered lighting a candle but didn't want to have a mishap with the one-of-a-kind handwritten recipes. Leaning against the kitchen counter, she rolled her eyes heavenward. "Sorry about that, Gram," she said.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze found the smoke detector. <i>Aha,</i> she thought. She dragged a kitchen chair over to it and climbed up, opening the smoke detector, removing its two double-A batteries and fitting them in the flashlight.</p><p> </p><p>She headed back into the pantry, gently picking up the papers, which rustled like dry autumn leaves. She put the loose papers in the box and brought it out to the kitchen. There were old notes and recipes in her grandmother's native Polish. On the back of a yellowed page with crumbling edges, she spotted a signature in fading, delicate strokes of ink <i>Helenka Maciejewski</i> practiced a dozen times in a girlish hand. That was her grandmother's married name before it had been Anglicized. She must have written it as a young bride.</p><p> </p><p>There were things about her grandparents Jenny would never know. What had it been like for them, as newlyweds barely out of childhood, leaving the only home they knew to start a life half a world away? Were they frightened? Excited? Did they quarrel with each other, cling to each other?</p><p> </p><p>She closed her eyes as a now-familiar onslaught of panic started in her stomach and pushed through her, pressing at her chest. These panic attacks were something brand-new for Jenny, a grim and unexpected development. The first one struck at the hospital as she was moving woodenly through the duties of the next of kin. She'd been signing some form or other when the fingers of her left hand went numb and she dropped the pen to clutch her throat."I can't breathe," she'd told the clerk. "I think I'm having a heart attack."</p><p> </p><p>The doctor who treated her, a tired-looking resident from Tonawanda, had been calm and compassionate as he evaluated her and then explained the condition. Not uncommon, the intense attack was a physical response to emotional trauma, the symptoms as real and frightening as they would be for any illness.</p><p> </p><p>Since then, Jenny had become intimately familiar with the symptoms. Practical, levelheaded Jenny Majesky was not supposed to succumb to something as uncontrollable and irrational as a panic attack. She was helpless to stop it now as a singularly unpleasant sensation rose through her, like a parade of spiders climbing up her throat. Her heart seemed to expand in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She cast a wild look around, wondering where she'd left the bottle of pills the doctor had given her. She hated the pills almost as much as she hated the panic attacks. Why couldn't she just snap out of it? Why couldn't she just suck it up and calm herself with a cup of strong coffee and a taste of her grandmother's apricotjam kolaches?</p><p> </p><p>That, at least, could be a diversion. Right now, in the middle of the night. One of the few places in Avalon where she could find someone awake at four in the morning was the Sky River Bakery, founded in 1952 by her grandparents. Helen specialized in kolaches filled with fruit or sweet cheese, and pies that became the stuff of local legend. Her baked goods were in demand from the restaurants and small specialty shops that lined the town square, catering to the well-polished tourists who came up from New York City for Avalon's cool green summers or blazing fall color.</p><p> </p><p>Now Jenny was the bakery's sole owner. She dressed hurriedly, layering on fleece long underwear, checked chef pants and a thick wool sweater, tall warm boots, a ski jacket and hat. No way was she driving, not before the snowplow had made its rounds. Besides, getting the car out of the garage would entail shoveling the driveway, something she was heartily sick of doing. The bakery was just six blocks away, on the main square in the center oftown. She'd be there in minutes. Maybe the exertion would stave off the panic attack, too.</p><p> </p><p>Just in case, she found her bottle of pills and stuffed it in her pocket.</p><p> </p><p>Grabbing her purse, she walked through frozen silence. The snow had stopped, and the clouds made way for the stars. New snow squeaked beneath her feet as she followed a route she'd walked since she was a tiny girl. She'd grown up in the bakery, surroun...</p></p><h2>Hell&#39;s Faire (Posleen War Series #4)</h2><p>With the defenses of the Southern Appalachians sundered, the only thing standing between the ravening Posleen hordes and the soft interior of the Cumberland Plateau are the veterans of 555th Mobile Infantry. Dropped into Rabun Pass, with a couple of million Posleen behind them and fourteen million to the front, the only question is which will run out first: power, bullets or bodies. But they have a hole card: far to the north the shattered SheVa Nine is undergoing a facelift. Rising from its smoking ashes is a new weapon of war, armed with the most advanced weaponry Terra has ever produced, capable of facing both the Posleen hordes and their redoubtable space-cruisers. Capable of dealing out hell as only SheVa Nine can. If Mike O'Neal and the other members of the 555th are going to survive, it will come down to how much Posleen butt Bun-bun can kick. <i>Prepare to eat antimatter</i>, Posleen-boy.</p><p>John Ringo is author of the New York Times best-selling Legacy of Aldenata (Posleen War) series, which so far includes A Hymn Before Battle and nine sequels, the technothriller series starting with Ghost, a dark fantasy titled Princess of Wands, and many other novels for Baen. A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Humanity's war against the nasty alien Posleens continues in military SF author Ringo's latest entry in his popular Legacy of the Aldenata series (after 2002's When the Devil Dances), but the unambivalent, almost innocent joie de combat of the earlier, pre-9/11 books is missing here. Having learned to combine human strategy with superior (although captured) technology, a Posleen overlord threatens to break through into unoccupied human territory. Opposing this effort are Major Mike O'Neal and his battalion of armored combat suits, plus conventional armor units lead by a Brobdingnagian mobile gun with a razor-wielding cartoon rabbit emblazoned on its side. The battle scenes are as vivid as ever, but the consequences lie more heavily than before on the warriors, as when O'Neal approves a nuclear strike near where his remaining family are located in order to save his command. It becomes increasingly clear that some alien "allies" would prefer that the humans and Posleens destroy one another and leave the galactic status quo undisturbed. Attentive readers may notice some overlap with When the Devil Dances, which Ringo explains in an afterword. Despite the overall dark tone, the author's trademark gallows humor shines through ("This is what you get for letting rednecks play with antimatter, boss"). So does a bit of hope: Ringo concludes his afterword by asserting "the good guys always win in the end." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Silver Door (Three Doors Trilogy)</h2><p><b>Internationally bestselling author Emily Rodda returns to the world of Deltora in book two of her brilliant new trilogy.</b><br><br>Rye made it through the golden Door and rescued his oldest brother, but his troubles are far from over.

In ancient times, the warrior learned to master the challenges of life, both on and off the battlefield. He acquired a sense of personal freedom and power&#x2014;not through violence or aggression, but through gentleness, courage, and self-knowledge. The Japanese samurai, the warrior-kings of Tibet, the knights of medieval Europe, and the warriors of the Native American tribes are a few examples of this universal tradition of wisdom. <br><br>With this book the warrior's path is opened to contemporary men and women in search of self-mastery and greater fulfillment. Interpreting the warrior's journey in modern terms, Trungpa discusses such skills as synchronizing mind and body, overcoming habitual behaviors, relaxing within discipline, facing the world with openness and fearlessness, and finding the sacred dimension of everyday life. Above all, Trungpa shows that in discovering the basic goodness or human life, the warrior learns to radiate that goodness out into the world for the peace and sanity of others. <br><br>The Shambhala teachings&#x2014;named for a legendary Himalayan kingdom where prosperity and happiness reign&#x2014;thus point to the potential for enlightened conduct that exists within every human being. "The basic wisdom of Shambhala," Trungpa writes, "is that in this world, as it is, we can find a good and meaningful human life that will also serve others. That is our true richness."</p><p>Presents the code of the warrior as a way for modern men and women to meet the challenges of life with fearlessness and dignity.Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

In a rave review in the <i>New York Times Book Review,</i> Tony Earley wrote, "In the high tradition of the Southern novel, Gay is unafraid to tackle the biggest of the big themes, nor does he shy away from the grand gesture that makes those themes manifest," and the <i>Denver Post</i> heralded it as "a novel of great emotional power." <br><br>With <b>PROVINCES OF NIGHT,</b> Gay's talent is undeniable. The year is 1952, and E. F. Bloodworth has returned to his home--a forgotten corner of Tennessee--after twenty years of roaming. The wife he walked out on has withered and faded, his three sons are grown and angry. Warren is a womanizing alcoholic, Boyd is driven by jealousy to hunt down his wife's lover, and Brady puts hexes on his enemies from his mamma's porch. Only Fleming, the old man's grandson, treats him with the reverence his age commands, and sees past all the hatred to realize the way it can poison a man's soul. Fleming, a seventeen-year-old dreamer, interprets this seemingly stark world with the uncynical wit and wisdom of the young. When he encounters Raven Lee, a sloe-eyed beauty from a neighboring town, he slowly finds the courage to face this family curse.<br><br>In a tale redolent with the crumbling loyalties and age-old strife of the South, Gay's characters inhabit a world driven by blood ties that strangle as they bind.<br></p><p>In his second novel, <i>Provinces of Night</i>, William Gay re-creates the oppressive, evocative atmosphere of the American Deep South that he first explored in his debut novel, <i>The Long Home</i>. Against the backdrop of rural Tennessee in the 1950s, our teenage protagonist, Fleming Bloodworth, finds himself alone in the family home after his father, Boyd, abandons him to hunt down and kill his wife's lover. At the same time, Fleming's grandfather decides to return to his family after 20 years of self-imposed exile. He returns to discover that his remaining two sons, Warren and Brady, are in turn an alcoholic womanizer and a Bible-quoting fantasist who enjoys putting curses on his enemies. <p> This is a self-consciously big novel in the Southern tradition that could easily have buckled under the weight of its own ambition. Instead, Gay pulls it off with ease, presenting us with a stream of unforgettable characters. While the central themes of love, loyalty, and forgiveness are explored seriously and sensitively, the finely wrought prose is also sprinkled with moments of genuine humor as Gay proves that he's not afraid to gently mock his gang of Southern eccentrics. This is a wonderful novel and a worthy successor to the tradition it so obviously admires. <i>--Jane Morris, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"<b>PROVINCES OF NIGHT</b> is simply brilliant. William Gay writes with such astonishing clarity and authenticity that every single word inside this book rings true. Poetic and visceral, his words excavate a corner of the South with a new standard of excellence and readers and writers everywhere are the better for it. A must-read for anyone aware of the changing pulse of American literature."<br>-- Melinda Haynes, author of <b>Mother of Pearl</b><br> <br>"<b>PROVINCES OF NIGHT</b> is an old-fashioned barrel-aged shot of Tennessee storytelling. Gay's tale of ancient wrongs and men with guns is high-proof stuff." <br>-Elwood Reid, author of <b>What Salmon Know</b> and <b>Midnight Sun</b><br><br>"<b>PROVINCES OF NIGHT</b> is one magnificent achievement, a wise, spare, hilarious, bighearted tale delivered in language as lovely as the Tennessee hills at dusk. To the list of premier Southern writers that includes Harry Crews, Barry Hannah, and Lewis Nordan, add the name of William Gay."<br>-Tom Franklin, author of <b>Poachers</b><br><br>"It is time to stop calling William Gay an exciting new voice. In <b>PROVINCES OF NIGHT</b> he proves that he is simply one of our finest voices."<br>--Steve Yarbrough, author of <b>The Oxygen Man</b><br><br>"A staggering talent.

Distinguished by the journalism of National Public Radio columnist Margot Adler, <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> explains this diverse and burgeoning religion's philosophies and activities while dispelling stereotypes that have long been associated with it. Most people don't realize that <i>pagan</i> simply refers to pre-Christian polytheistic nature religions, such as the various Native American creeds, Japanese Shinto, Celtic Druid, and Western European Wicca. Originally, the word <i>pagan</i> meant "country dweller" and was a derogatory term in Rome in the third century A.D., not unlike calling someone a hick today. If you find yourself feeling queasy when you hear the words <i>witch</i> or <i>pagan</i>, a healthy dose of reeducation via <i>Drawing Down the Moon</i> could be the cure. <i>--P.

What goes on in the artist's mind? What different techniques are used in creating a still life, landscape, or portrait? In this look at the complex, often mysterious painting process, painter/museum director Thomas S. Buechner combines clear how-to instruction with striking insights to help us look at pictures in a wholly new way. <p>An expert on painting techniques, Buechner offers valuable tips for both amateur and professional painters on traditional methods that many schools do not teach today. An impassioned painter himself, whose work hangs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art, Buechner includes illustrations of many of his most inspired paintings and drawings-some shown in step-by-step series with enlarged details-illuminating for us the intimate relationship between the artist and his materials. </p><p>129 illustrations, 98 in full color, 8 1/2 x 10 3/4" </p><p>THOMAS S. BUECHNER, former director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Corning Museum of Glass, is the author of several books, most notably Abrams' definitive biography Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator. In addition to his long experience in interpreting works of art for museumgoers, Buechner brings to this book the perspective gained from decades of teaching painting.</p></p><p>Thomas S. Buechner is an accomplished artist who has painted some 2,500 pictures in his long career, some of which are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American Art. For <i>How I Paint: Secrets of a Sunday Painter</i>, he selected 50 works that he uses to illustrate what, why, and how he paints. The book explores not only how paintings can be better appreciated and enjoyed (Buechner is also the former director of the Brooklyn Museum and the Corning Museum of Glass), it also reveals the working insights that go into making a painting vital. Buechner outlines traditional methods of composition that many art schools no longer teach today. Though capable of composing majestic, calm landscapes and still lives of such exactitude and feeling that even a lowly red onion seems poised to address the viewer, Buechner excels in portraiture. He tends to place his sitters in dark, empty space, explaining, "We are, each of us, quite alone, and that's what I try to paint." This is a book about technique, practice, and the timeless fundamentals of the creative process from the perspective of a mature artist whose works reflect the luminescent lessons of the old masters. <i>--Mary Ribesky</i>At age 73, Buechner looked at the rest of his life and decided that it was time to be tidying up my thoughts on painting. From this modest premise, he has written a thoughtful, very personal work on oil painting. His chapters on tools, composition, and the painting of portraits, still lifes, etc., are well done. It is his meditations on topics like Knowing, Seeing, Wanting and Reality and Imagination, that give this book depth. The author!s years as director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Corning Museum of Glass and his decades of teaching painting lend a authority to his sensitive words.

Celebrated and vilified the world over for his courageous but bitter fight to gain for millions of black men and women the equality and respect denied them by their white neighbours, Malcolm X inspired as many people in the United States as he caused to fear him.His remarkable autobiography, completed just before his murder in 1965, ranges from Omaha and Michigan to Harlem and Mecca, and tells of a young, disenfranchised man whose descent into drug addition, robbery and prison was only reversed by his belief in the rights struggle for black America, and his conversion to the Nation of Islam. Not only is this an enormously important record of the Civil Rights Movement in America, but also the scintillating story of a man who refused to allow anyone to tell him who or what he was.</p><p>If there was any one man who articulated the anger, the struggle, and the beliefs of African Americans in the 1960s, that man was Malxolm X. His AUTOBIOGRAPHY is now an established classic of modern America, a book that expresses like none other the crucial truth about our times.<br>"Extraordinary. A brilliant, painful, important book."<br>TEH NEW YORKTIMESBorn Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925, Malcolm X lost both his parents at a young age. Leaving school early, he soon became part of Harlem&#39;s underworld, and in 1946 he was sentenced to ten years&#39; imprisonment. It was in prison that Malcolm X converted to Islam. Paroled in 1952, he became an outspoken defender of Muslim doctrines, formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity in 1963, and had received considerable publicity by the time of his murder in 1965.</p><h2>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</h2><p>The entire book, with its unconventional page arrangement and eclectic, frenetic mix of text and pictures, is a spoof on the art of book design and the art of the fairy tale. The individual tales, such as The Really Ugly Duckling and Little Red Running Shorts, can be extracted for telling aloud, with great success. Another masterpiece from the team that created The True Story of the Three Little Pigs! -Horn Book If geese had graves, Mother Goose would be rolling in hers. The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales retells--and wreaks havoc on--the allegories we all thought we knew by heart. In these irreverent variations on well-known themes, the ugly duckling grows up to be an ugly duck, and the princess who kisses the frog wins only a mouthful of amphibian slime. The Stinky Cheese Man deconstructs not only the tradition of the fairy tale but also the entire notion of a book. Our naughty narrator, Jack, makes a mockery of the title page, the table of contents, and even the endpaper by shuffling, scoffing, and generally paying no mind to structure. Characters slide in and out of tales; Cinderella rebuffs Rumpelstiltskin, and the Giant at the top of the beanstalk snacks on the Little Red Hen. There are no lessons to be learned or morals to take to heart--just good, sarcastic fun that smart-alecks of all ages will love.</p><p>If geese had graves, Mother Goose would be rolling in hers. <i>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</i> retells--and wreaks havoc on--the allegories we all thought we knew by heart.

Naturally, many questions follow: How has the Orthodox liturgy been shaped? How different is it from the Eucharistic rites of the Western churches? Hugh Wybrew&#39;s authoritative, but splendidly readable, book traces step-by-step the story of the development of the Orthodox liturgy from the Last Supper to the present day and vividly conveys a sense of the experience of the worshipers.</p><p>Hugh Wybrew is an Anglican priest who has studied Orthodoxy for many years.

On a life-changing odyssey to an ancient culture, he meets Himalayan gurus who offer powerful, wise and practical lessons that teach us to: - Develop joyful thoughts - Follow our life&#39;s mission - Cultivate self-discipline and act courageously - Value time as our most important commodity - Nourish our relationships - Live fully, one day at a time</p><p>Everyone loves a good fable, and this is certainly one. The protagonist is Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice, such as, "What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you." Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>Here is the story of Julian Mantle, a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment, he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture, where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind, body, and soul and learns to live with passion, purpose, and peace. Brilliantly blending ancient spiritual wisdom of the east with contemporary success principles of the West, this inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage, balance, abundance and joy.</p><h2>Turmoil in the Toybox</h2><p>The cassette deals with the way toys and cartoons are being used to introduce the occult, violence and pagan religions to millions of our children.</p><p></p><h2>The Williamsburg Art of Cookery</h2><p>These favorite &#34;receipts&#34; are known to have been used in Virginia households in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Seventytwo days later, the body was found in the woods next to a roadway, a short distance from Lindbergh&#x2019;s house. In 1927, Lindbergh was the first to fly the Atlantic. By 1932, he was perhaps the most famous man alive. A great hero, he was allowed to be the chief architect of the investiga-tion into his son&#x2019;s kidnapping. In this capacity, the first thing he did was to have the body cremated without an autopsy. Was this done on purpose? Or, was it done for emotional reasons?

Conflict as well as courage helped forge the distinctive Wesleyan emphases that constituted for them the &#34;scripture way of salvation.&#34; We see the evolution of practical ways to nourish &#34;holiness of heart and life&#34; through the development of societies and schools, classes and bands, conferences and clinics, and many other forms of organization and mission that eventually secure Methodism into the social and religious fabric of British society.</p><p>Richard P.

Syaf lives in Indonesia.Introduction by Jim Butcher<br>I know <i>The Dresden Files</i> got a lot of people&#x2019;s attention when it aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, but there&#x2019;s a secret I&#x2019;ve been needing to get off my chest: In my head, it&#x2019;s always been an animated cartoon. In fact, when I&#x2019;m writing it, I actually see panels from a comic book&#x2013;sorry, graphic novel&#x2013;in my mind&#x2019;s eye. <br> <br>So when the Dabel Brothers came along and expressed an interest in adapting the books to a graphic novel format, I couldn&#x2019;t have been happier.<br><br>See, back in the day (when you just called them "comic books" and "graphic novels" wouldn&#x2019;t really come into common use until the release of Frank Miller&#x2019;s <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> in 1986), I collected a lot of titles. In point of fact, from 1983 to 1986, I collected every single Marvel title with the exception of the overtly marketed toy tie-in titles (<i>Transformers, GI Joe</i>) and those less-than-successful "New Universe" titles. <br> <br>Yeah. All of them. <br> <br>I stopped looking up the value of all those titles about a quarter of the way in. It was too depressing. My mom threw 99 percent of them away when I was off at college. Not that I would have sold them, anyway. Money might be money, but what I loved were the stories; the heroes, the villains, the victims, the explosions, desperate battles, heroic sacrifice&#x2013;the stuff of legends. At least, they were to that 12- to 15-year-old boy. Those comic books&#x2013;they were NOT graphic novels back then&#x2013;stirred my imagination and deeply influenced the kinds of stories I would write myself one day. <br> <br>So when the Dabels offered me the chance to write an original story in the Dresden Files, as an introduction for the adaptation of the novels, I jumped at the chance! Ah hah! I&#x2019;d gotten to write a Spider-Man novel for Marvel, but this was going to be even better! <br> <br>Nobody told me how much *work* it would be. <br> <br>I mean, a picture is worth a thousand words, right? Well, there are between one and six pictures on every single page of a graphic novel, and when you&#x2019;re the writer, you&#x2019;re the one who has to produce the thousand words. You&#x2019;ve got to tell the artist what you want on the page, give him some idea of perspective, of mood and tone, and generally give him a good notional skeleton to draw the sketches on. When you&#x2019;re a noob writer for this format, like me, you also have to work out when you&#x2019;re asking for the impossible and when you&#x2019;re telling the artist everything he doesn&#x2019;t need to know, and nothing that he does. <br> <br>It&#x2019;s intense. In its own way, it&#x2019;s harder than writing a novel. <br> <br>I&#x2019;m really proud of the results. <br> <br>"Welcome to the Jungle" is a story set in the world of the Dresden Files, immediately prior to the events of <i>Storm Front.</i> Drawn by the tremendously gifted newcomer Ardian Syaf, I can honestly say that the representation of the characters found here is very, very close to the images of them that exist in my head. Harry is bang-on, in particular, and I just keep getting more impressed with the art being produced to go with the story I&#x2019;ve written. Put together, I think they make for a fine comic book. <br> <br>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll apologize for that one. Comic books opened up a whole universe of imagination to a kid who rushed to the local comic shop each week, eager to buy issues for seventy-five cents to one dollar apiece. Comic books helped awaken my own desire to tell stories, and played a pivotal role in shaping my own storytelling style. I see no slur in the name, no disrespect, and never have. <br> <br>Even so, I can respect the opinions of others. So welcome to the first issue of the first original Dresden Files graphic novel&#x2013;"Welcome to the Jungle." <br> <br>Enjoy.</p><h2>Clinical Behavioral Medicine For Small Animals</h2><p>Here's authoritative scientifically based guidance on preventing, diagnosing, and successfully treating behavior cases.

A major reason for the singular celebrity of this most popular and versatile of the great French writers is <i>Les Mis�rables </i>(1862). In this story of the trials of the peasant Jean Valjean&#x2014;a man unjustly imprisoned, baffled by destiny, and hounded by his nemesis, the magnificently realized, ambiguously malevolent police detective Javert&#x2014;Hugo achieves the sort of rare imaginative resonance that allows a work of art to transcend its genre.<br><i><br>Les Mis�rables </i>is at once a tense thriller that contains one of the most compelling chase scenes in all literature, an epic portrayal of the nineteenth-century French citizenry, and a vital drama&#x2014;highly particularized and poetic in its rendition but universal in its implications&#x2014;of the redemption of one human being.</p></p><p>Sensational, dramatic, packed with rich excitement and filled with the sweep and violence of human passions, LES MISERABLES is not only superb adventure but a powerful social document. The story of how the convict Jean-Valjean struggled to escape his past and reaffirm his humanity, in a world brutalized by poverty and ignorance, became the gospel of the poor and the oppressed. <p>"From the Paperback edition.</p>Victor Hugo (1802-85), novelist, poet, playwright, and French national icon, is best known for two of today&#x2019;s most popular world classics: <i>Les Mis�rables </i>and <i>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</i>, as well as other works, including <i>The Toilers of the Sea</i> and <i>The Man Who Laughs</i>. Hugo was elected to the Acad�mie Fran�aise in 1841. As a statesman, he was named a Peer of France in 1845. He served in France&#x2019;s National Assemblies in the Second Republic formed after the 1848 revolution, and in 1851 went into self-imposed exile upon the ascendance of Napoleon III, who restored France&#x2019; s government to authoritarian rule.

He is the author of <i>The Craft of Ralph Ellison</i> and <i>Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday</i>, and the principal writer of <i>Seeing Jazz</i>, the catalog for the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s exhibit on jazz painting and literature.<p><b>From Robert G. O'Meally's Introduction to&nbsp;<i>Billy Budd and The Piazza Tales</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bear in mind that while The Piazza Tales has been received as a classic in our time, in Melville&#x2019;s own day he was correct; the book did not sell well. In a sad exchange of letters, Melville eventually turned down the publisher&#x2019;s offer to purchase the metal plates used to print the book, in case he wanted them for possible future printings; but, alas, he could not afford them. Having no further use for the plates for The Piazza Tales, Harper had them melted down and sold as scrap metal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For further perspective on The Piazza Tales, let us commence with Billy Budd, our volume&#x2019;s first narrative. This is Melville&#x2019;s last work of fiction, written, along with occasional poems, not with a clear sense of the market but for himself, left unfinished (brought to a sort of completion but clearly not as polished as he intended), and then not published until 1924, thirty-three years after the writer&#x2019;s death. Here is a mighty tale, compressed in the manner of a Greek tragedy, tersely eloquent, and informed, as we shall see, by a strange comedy and by an even stranger murmurous sound that is close to the spirit of the blues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like so much of Melville&#x2019;s writing, Billy Budd is shadowed by the presence of a powerful and beautiful black figure associated with freedom. In the novel&#x2019;s second paragraph, the stage is set for the reader to meet the mythically handsome and mystically good sailor Billy (called by some &#x201c;Baby&#x201d;) Budd, with an invitation to consider a prior case of perfection in the shape of&nbsp; &#x201c;a common sailor so intensely black that he must needs have been a native African of the unadulterate blood of Ham&#x2014;a symmetric figure much above the average height.&#x201d; Ear-ringed with large gold hoops and dressed in colorful silk, this black sailor, seen in Liverpool, was the uncontested leader of&nbsp; &#x201c;such an assortment of tribes and complexions as would have well fitted them to be marched up by Anacharsis Cloots before the bar of the first French Assembly as Representatives of the Human Race.&#x201d; As the charismatic figure in black walked among the other sailors, exchanging pleasantries, his colleagues praised him, paused and stared at him, &#x201c;they took that sort of pride . . . which the Assyrian priests doubtless showed for their grand sculptured Bull when the faithful prostrated themselves.&#x201d; This black man is like a figurehead to Melville&#x2019;s ship of a novella; we glimpse him only as we board. But he shadows the text in the godlike figure of Billy Budd himself. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>Billy is a leader not by virtue of official rank, treasury, or pedigree (like many mythic heroes he is uncertain of his family origins or true home) but through his personal excellence alone. Breathtakingly handsome, Billy is admired by his shipmates for his bubbling good cheer, for his love of doing good deeds, and when the situation demanded it, for his terrible swift fists. And like the black sailor in Liverpool&#x2014;or any sailor on any ship within the scope of the British fleet (which sailed the world)&#x2014;Billy Budd is subject to English &#x201c;impressment,&#x201d; the practice of boarding ships at sea and seizing men for service in the British navy. Thus taken from the ship called, significantly enough, the Rights-of-Man (so christened, we are informed, after Thomas Paine&#x2019;s pamphlet in defense of the French Revolution), Billy has been &#x201c;impressed&#x201d; into service as a British seaman. According to his steady nature and fatalistic outlook, the seized man does not complain. &#x201c;But, indeed,&#x201d; as the tale&#x2019;s narrator informs us, &#x201c;any demur would have been as idle as the protest of a goldfinch popped into a cage.&#x201d;</p><h2>Up the Organization: How to Stop the Corporation from Stifling People and Strangling Profits</h2><p>Although it was first published more than thirty-five years ago, <i>Up the Organization</i> continues to top the lists of best business books by groups as diverse as the American Management Association, <i>Strategy + Business</i> (Booz Allen Hamilton), and The Wharton Center for Leadership and Change Management. 1-800-CEO-READ ranks Townsend&#x2019;s bestseller first among eighty books that &#x201c;every manager must read.&#x201d; <p>This commemorative edition offers a new generation the benefit of Robert Townsend&#x2019;s timeless wisdom as well as reflections on his work and life by those who knew and worked with him.

Now, award-winning nature writer David Gessner follows the ghosts of these two remarkable writer-environmentalists from Stegner's birthplace in Saskatchewan to the site of Abbey's pilgrimages to Arches National Park in Utah, braiding their stories and asking how they speak to the lives of all those who care about the West.</p><p>These two great westerners had very different ideas about what it meant to love the land and try to care for it, and they did so in distinctly different styles. Boozy, lustful, and irascible, Abbey was best known as the author of the novel <em>The Monkey Wrench Gang</em> (and also of the classic nature memoir <em>Desert Solitaire</em>), famous for spawning the idea of guerrilla actions&#x2015;known to admirers as "monkeywrenching" and to law enforcement as domestic terrorism&#x2015;to disrupt commercial exploitation of western lands. By contrast, Stegner, a buttoned-down, disciplined, faithful family man and devoted professor of creative writing, dedicated himself to working through the system to protect western sites such as Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado.</p><p>In a region beset by droughts and fires, by fracking and drilling, and by an ever-growing population that seems to be in the process of loving the West to death, Gessner asks: how might these two farseeing environmental thinkers have responded to the crisis?</p><p>Gessner takes us on an inspiring, entertaining journey as he renews his own commitment to cultivating a meaningful relationship with the wild, confronting American overconsumption, and fighting environmental injustice&#x2015;all while reawakening the thrill of the words of his two great heroes.</p></p><p><strong>David Gessner</strong> is the award-winning author of <em>Return of the Osprey, My Green Manifesto, The Tarball Chronicles</em>, and other books.

The moralist in question is Jakob Fabian, &#x201c;aged thirty-two, profession variable, at present advertising copywriter . . . weak heart, brown hair,&#x201d; a young man with an excellent education but permanently condemned to a low-paid job without security in the short or the long run.<br><br>What&#x2019;s to be done? Fabian and friends make the best of it&#x2014;they go to work though they may be laid off at any time, and in the evenings they go to the cabarets and try to make it with girls on the make, all the while making a lot of sharp-sighted and sharp-witted observations about politics, life, and love, or what may be. Not that it makes a difference. Workers keep losing work to new technologies while businessmen keep busy making money, and everyone who can goes out to dance clubs and sex clubs or engages in marathon bicycle events, since so long as there&#x2019;s hope of running into the right person or (even) doing the right thing, well&#x2014;why stop?<br><br><i>Going to the Dogs</i>, in the words of introducer Rodney Livingstone, &#x201c;brilliantly renders with tangible immediacy the last frenetic years [in Germany] before 1933.&#x201d; It is a book for our time too.</p><p>Erich K�stner (1899&#x2013;1974) was born in Dresden and after serving in World War I studied history and philosophy in Leipzig, completing a PhD. In 1927 he moved to Berlin and through his prolific journalism quickly became a major intellectual figure in the capital. His first book of poems was published in 1928, as was the children&#x2019;s book <i>Emil and the Detectives</i>, which quickly achieved worldwide fame. <i>Going to the Dogs</i> appeared in 1931 and was followed by many other<br>works for adults and children, including <i>Lottie and Lisa</i>, the basis for the popular Disney film <i>The Parent Trap</i>. In 1933 the pacifist K�stner was banned from German publication and subsequently found employment as a film scriptwriter. After World War II, he worked as a literary editor and continued to write, mainly for children.<br><br>Cyrus Brooks translated works by Alfred Neumann, Friedrich Du&#x308;rrenmatt, and Leonhard Frank as well as K�stner&#x2019;s <i>Emil and the Detectives</i>, <i>Emil and the Three Twins</i>, and <i>Lottie and Lisa</i>.<br><br>Rodney Livingstone is a professor emeritus in German studies at the University of Southampton and a translator of books by Theodor W. Adorno, Max Weber, and Walter Benjamin, among others. In 2009 he was awarded the Ungar German Translation Prize of the American Translators Association.&#x201c;K�stner (1899-1974) had a message to convey about the crumbling of Berlin's moral standards, and he delivered it successfully....but it is Fabian himself who explains things best when he comments ironically, &#x2018;We live in stirring times . . . and they get more stirring every day.'&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Like his hero Fabian, K�stner was not a cynic as a saddened idealist; the two conditions look much the same, but the latter is more painful....<i>Fabian </i>is a "key novel" of the Weimar Republic in its last years. It is a notably efficient novel, with little of the metaphysical resonance of [Thomas Mann&#x2019;s] <i>Doctor Faustus </i>or that book&#x2019;s soul-searching, but offering instead a series of moral tableaux, rendered the cooler by the chapter titles, in the form of newspaper headings.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The Times Literary Supplement</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Graceful, vivid and distinguished...a little masterpiece of pathos and calamity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Sadleir<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Damned for its improper subject-matter, [<i>Going to the Dogs</i>] showed the crumbling Berlin of Christopher Isherwood&#x2019;s stories with something of Isherwood&#x2019;s sharp intelligence, but a far more tragic sense of implication.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;The Times Literary Supplement</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am a great admirer of <i>Fabian </i>[original title] and have read it at least twice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Graham Greene<br></p><h2>Engaging Learners Through Artmaking: Choice-Based Art Education in the Classroom</h2><p>This dynamic resource details the philosophy, rationale, and implementation of choice-based authentic art education in elementary and middle schools.

Synesthetes rarely talk about their peculiar sensory gift&#x2015;believing either that everyone else senses the world exactly as they do, or that no one else does. Yet synesthesia occurs in one in twenty people, and is even more common among artists. One famous synesthete was novelist Vladimir Nabokov, who insisted as a toddler that the colors on his wooden alphabet blocks were &#x201c;all wrong.&#x201d; His mother understood exactly what he meant because she, too, had synesthesia. Nabokov's son Dmitri, who recounts this tale in the afterword to this book, is also a synesthete&#x2015;further illustrating how synesthesia runs in families. </p><p>In <i>Wednesday Is Indigo Blue</i>, pioneering researcher Richard Cytowic and distinguished neuroscientist David Eagleman explain the neuroscience and genetics behind synesthesia's multisensory experiences. Because synesthesia contradicted existing theory, Cytowic spent twenty years persuading colleagues that it was a real&#x2015;and important&#x2015;brain phenomenon rather than a mere curiosity. Today scientists in fifteen countries are exploring synesthesia and how it is changing the traditional view of how the brain works. Cytowic and Eagleman argue that perception is already multisensory, though for most of us its multiple dimensions exist beyond the reach of consciousness.

His dream was at times characterized as a benevolent interest in the brotherhood of man, sometimes as a brute interest in the exercise of power. Green, a Cambridge-trained classicist who is also a novelist, portrays Alexander as both a complex personality and a single-minded general, a man capable of such diverse expediencies as patricide or the massacre of civilians. Green describes his Alexander as "not only the most brilliant (and ambitious) field commander in history, but also supremely indifferent to all those administrative excellences and idealistic yearnings foisted upon him by later generations, especially those who found the conqueror, tout court, a little hard upon their liberal sensibilities."<br><br>This biography begins not with one of the universally known incidents of Alexander's life, but with an account of his father, Philip of Macedonia, whose many-territoried empire was the first on the continent of Europe to have an effectively centralized government and military. What Philip and Macedonia had to offer, Alexander made his own, but Philip and Macedonia also made Alexander form an important context for understanding Alexander himself. Yet his origins and training do not fully explain the man. After he was named hegemon of the Hellenic League, many philosophers came to congratulate Alexander, but one was conspicuous by his absence: Diogenes the Cynic, an ascetic who lived in a clay tub. Piqued and curious, Alexander himself visited the philosopher, who, when asked if there was anything Alexander could do for him, made the famous reply, "Don't stand between me and the sun." Alexander's courtiers jeered, but Alexander silenced them: "If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes." This remark was as unexpected in Alexander as it would be in a modern leader.<br><br>For the general reader, the book, redolent with gritty details and fully aware of Alexander's darker side, offers a gripping tale of Alexander's career. Full backnotes, fourteen maps, and chronological and genealogical tables serve readers with more specialized interests.</p><p>There's no shortage of biographies available on Alexander the Great, but Peter Green's <i>Alexander of Macedon</i> is one of the finest. The prose is crisp and clear, and within a few pages readers become absorbed in the world that made Alexander, and then the story of how Alexander remade it. Green writes, "Alexander's true genius was as a field-commander: perhaps, taken all in all, the most incomparable general the world has ever seen. His gift for speed, improvisation, variety of strategy; his cool-headedness in a crisis; his ability to extract himself from the most impossible situations; his mastery of terrain; his psychological ability to penetrate the enemy's intentions--all these qualities place him at the very head of the Great Captains of history."<b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of <i>Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age</i> (California, 1990).</p><h2>Introduction to Chemical Processes: Principles, Analysis, Synthesis (Mcgraw-hill Chemical Engineering Series)</h2><p>Introduction to Chemical Processes: Principles, Analysis, Synthesis enhances student understanding of the connection between the chemistry and the process.

I open my show with it because I know people are gonna request it until I sing it. I wrote it myself, nine verses, and it broke my heart when I had to cut three verses out because it was too long. I could have written a thousand more verses, I've got so many memories of Butcher Holler.<br><br>To me, that place is the most important part of my life. My fans and writers are always making a big deal about me acting natural, right from the country. That's because I come from Butcher Holler, Kentucky, and I ain't never forgot it.<br><br>I'm always making Butcher Holler sound like the most backward part of the United States&#x2014;and I think maybe it is. I've travelled all over this country, down South and out West, and I ain't never seen anything like it. And I ain't making fun of it, because I'm the most backward person you ever saw. I never knew where babies came from until it happened to me.<br><br>This might give you an idea of how backward we are, but first, to appreciate this story, you've go to know that in eastern Kentucky we saw the word "press" instead of "closet." Anyway, one of my best friends is Dr. John Turner, who took care of me when I was younger. <br><br>Doc swears he saw this patient standing in front of the hospital elevator, looking confused. Doc asked him what was the matter, and the patient said, "Doc, I just seen a nurse get into that press&#x2014;and when the door opened she was gone!" See, that patient live in a holler all his life and never saw an elevator before. Myself, I never rode in an automobile until I was twelve.<br><br>Holler people are just different from anybody else. They live high up in the hills, one day at a time. There's probably a few who don't know who the president is, and there have been times when they were better off that way. Maybe things are changing now, with television and better roads and stuff, but I've got relatives living up in Butcher Holler who have never been further than Paintsville, ten miles away, in their lives. They're really beautiful people in their own way. Everybody else is worrying about the energy crisis, and talking about getting back to the simple things. My people are already there. If we run out of energy, my relatives know how to patch their houses and grow gardens, so they're gonna have the last laugh on everybody.<br><br>Let me explain where Butcher Holler is. You take any place in the United States today, and they've got an interstate highway, right? Well, you get on one of them interstates and drive to Huntington, West Virginia, which is already pretty hilly country&#x2014;but you ain't seen nothing yet. You get off Interstate 64 and head south along Highway 23 into Kentucky. That's a good three-lane highway going past some nice farms and factories and mobile homes. You drive for about an hour and a half until you get to Paintsville, which has around 4,000 people.<br><br>Paintsville may not look too big to outsiders, but in Johnson County it's the biggest thing going. That's the first place I ever saw a toilet with running water, just before I got married. I went into the bus station to go to the bathroom, but when I sat down on the seat, the toilet flushed automatically. I got so scared I was gonna get flushed down, I ran out of there and waited until we found a good old outhouse.<br>When I was a little girl, my big city was Van Lear, which was five miles away, a coal camp for the Consolidated Coal Company, with rows of wooden houses they rented to the miners. There must have been 10,000 people living around Van Lear in the good times. The company had a post office and company stores where you paid for you things in scrip. If you went into debt, you owed your soul to the company store, just like the song says. The company also had a recreation hall where they showed movies. People make coal camps sound like slavery, but in a lot of ways it was the best thing ever happened to people&#x2014;as long as coal kept running.<br><br>Before I was born, Van Lear was a boom town. The company kept their houses painted. The foremen had nice homes up on Silk Stocking row, and the bosses had real beautiful homes. Off to one side was a row of houses called Nigger Holler where the black miners lived. They worked in the mines with the whites, but they had to live off by themselves. I'm sure there was prejudice in the coal camps, but my family grew up so high in the hollers, we never knew about it.<br><br>My Daddy was color-blind in two ways. About the only color he could see real good was yellow, and I have troubled telling red from orange myself. But we were also color-blind about people. It's like in 1972, when I was up for the award for Best Female Singer on national television, and Charley Pride was going to present the award. People warned me not to kiss Charley in case I won, because it would hurt my popularity with country fans. I heard that one girl singer got canceled Down South after giving a little peck to a black friend on television. Well, Charley Pride is one of my favorite people in country music, and I got so mad that when I won I made sure I gave him a big old hug and a kiss right on camera. You know what? Nobody canceled on me. If they had, fine, I'd have gone home to my babies and canned some string beans and the heck with them all.</p><h2>Archaeology (Available Titles CengageNOW)</h2><p>This new edition by David Hurst Thomas and Robert L. Kelly pairs two of archaeology&#39;s most recognized names--with a combined 70 years of experience--for the first time. David Hurst Thomas of the American Museum of Natural History and Robert L. Kelly of the University of Wyoming bring readers a textbook rich with examples drawn from their experiences leading excavations over the past thirty years. A major revision, this fourth edition of ARCHAEOLOGY reflects the most recent research and changes in the field, while covering the core concepts in an exceptionally student-friendly fashion. This edition continues a tradition of academic rigor and engaging writing style that have made this text one of the most well-respected and best-selling texts in the discipline. The new edition is enhanced with full-color photos and a completely new design. The rich array of supplemental resources includes a new companion website, as well as the option to use a new CD-ROM, DOING FIELDWORK: ARCHAEOLOGICAL DEMONSTRATIONS developed by the authors.</p><p>David Hurst Thomas has served as Curator of Anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1972. A specialist in Native American archaeology, Thomas discovered both Gatecliff Shelter (Nevada) and the lost 16th- and 17th-century Franciscan mission Santa Catalina de Guale on St. Catherine&#39;s Island, Georgia. He has led the long-term excavation of Mission San Marcos near Santa Fe (New Mexico) and recently returned to St. Catherine&#39;s Island for long-term archaeological exploration. A founding trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian at the Smithsonian since 1989, Thomas has published extensively. His works include 100 papers and 30 books -- most recently, the bestselling Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and The Battle for Native American Identity. Archaeologist Thomas likes &#34;old stuff,&#34; including his 1961 Corvette, his 130-year-old house, and the Oakland Raiders."This is a very valuable introduction to archaeology and I predict that it will see wide use in the classroom. It is written in an enormously engaging manner (this cannot be overemphasized) and covers all the basics."<br><br>"It is well-written, easy to read, comprehensive, accurate, up-to-date, and the concepts are explained in a generally fun manner. I very much liked the fresh (new to this text) perspective and examples provided by Kelly."</p><h2>A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy (The Graz Schumpeter Lectures)</h2><p><p><b>Why Enlightenment culture sparked the Industrial Revolution</b></p><p>During the late eighteenth century, innovations in Europe triggered the Industrial Revolution and the sustained economic progress that spread across the globe. While much has been made of the details of the Industrial Revolution, what remains a mystery is why it took place at all. Why did this revolution begin in the West and not elsewhere, and why did it continue, leading to today's unprecedented prosperity? In this groundbreaking book, celebrated economic historian Joel Mokyr argues that a culture of growth specific to early modern Europe and the European Enlightenment laid the foundations for the scientific advances and pioneering inventions that would instigate explosive technological and economic development. Bringing together economics, the history of science and technology, and models of cultural evolution, Mokyr demonstrates that culture&#x2015;the beliefs, values, and preferences in society that are capable of changing behavior&#x2015;was a deciding factor in societal transformations.</p><p>Mokyr looks at the period 1500&#x2013;1700 to show that a politically fragmented Europe fostered a competitive "market for ideas" and a willingness to investigate the secrets of nature. At the same time, a transnational community of brilliant thinkers known as the &#x201c;Republic of Letters&#x201d; freely circulated and distributed ideas and writings. This political fragmentation and the supportive intellectual environment explain how the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe but not China, despite similar levels of technology and intellectual activity. In Europe, heterodox and creative thinkers could find sanctuary in other countries and spread their thinking across borders. In contrast, China&#x2019;s version of the Enlightenment remained controlled by the ruling elite.</p><p>Combining ideas from economics and cultural evolution, <i>A Culture of Growth</i> provides startling reasons for why the foundations of our modern economy were laid in the mere two centuries between Columbus and Newton.</p></p><p><p>"Many great minds have written many great books about why Europe spearheaded technological progress and economic growth in the past three centuries. Joel Mokyr has joined their ranks with admirable verve, erudition, and originality. In his account, a change in the beliefs, values, and preferences of Europeans drove them to accumulate, share, and apply knowledge as it had never been done before. Agree or disagree with Mokyr's thesis, you definitely need to take it seriously."<b>--Margaret Jacob, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"<i>A Culture of Growth</i>is an insightful quest into the economic history of the last five centuries. Mokyr's historical laboratory is early modern Europe, when a small mass of highly skilled artisans, entrepreneurs, financiers and merchants laid the roots of what was to become the Industrial Revolution."<b>--Angus Deaton, 2015 Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"Mokyr's new masterpiece is a virtuoso display of how new thinking in economics can bring a deeper understanding of one of the most important events in human history.<i>A Culture of Growth</i>documents the cultural shifts that permitted the interrogation of nature that then flowered into scientific advances. This book offers us an optimistic vision: a great expansion of communication preceded our modern prosperity, and we can expect this to happen again."<b>--Robert E. Lucas Jr., 1995 Nobel Laureate in Economics</b></p><p>"In this immensely learned book, Mokyr argues that a specific culture of growth anchored in the Republic of Letters, spread through the enlightened circuits beginning with Britain, and made the Industrial Revolution happen. Written by America's leading economic historian,<i>A Culture of Growth</i>is magisterial and long overdue."<b>Margaret Jacob, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"A giant among the masters of economic history, Mokyr has written a brilliant, persuasive, humane, penetrating, and sensationally good book. Mokyr looks at the immensely powerful idea of a progressive Baconian science, which stepped down from theory to enrich the modern world. The range of scholarship is astonishing and this major work will become a standard in the literature on economic growth."<b>--Daron Acemoglu, coauthor of<i>Why Nations Fail</i></b></p><p>"[Mokyr] reminds us that the skirmishing of philosophers and their ideas, the preoccupation of popular historians, is in many ways a sideshow--that the revolution that gave Europe dominance was, above all, scientific, and that the scientific revolution was, above all, an artisanal revolution."<b>--Diane Coyle,<i>Financial Times</i></b></p><p>"One has to admire the depth of knowledge and the subtlety of Mokyr's argument.... For serious students of the Enlightenment itself, Mokyr's magnum opus will be required reading for a long time to come."<b>--Arnold Kling,<i>Econlib</i></b></p><b>Joel Mokyr</b> is the Robert H. Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences and professor of economics and history at Northwestern University and Sackler Professor at the Eitan Berglas School of Economics at the University of Tel Aviv. His many books include <i>The Enlightened Economy</i> and <i>The Gifts of Athena</i> (Princeton).

Comprehensive and up-to-date, the text integrates major construction management topics with an explanation of the methods of heavy/highway and building construction. It incorporates both customary U.S. units and metric (SI) units and is the only text to present concrete formwork design equations and procedures using both measurement systems. This edition features information on the latest developments in soil excavation, asphalt paving, and earthmoving equipment. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p> The objective of this book is to guide construction engineers and construction managers in planning, estimating, and directing construction operations in a manner that will attain the best possible results. Based on the author's many years of experience in construction, engineering, and education, it is believed that the material presented is comprehensive enough to serve as the basic text for a variety of construction courses as well as for self-study. For an introductory course, upper-division college-level students should be able to cover much of the material in one semester. For more in-depth coverage, the material should be split between two or more courses. Topics may, of course, be omitted or augmented as appropriate to the nature of the course and the desires of the instructor. In solving the computer problems contained in the end-of-chapter exercises, students should be encouraged to use electronic spreadsheets and their associated functions in addition to conventional computer programming languages. It is strongly recommended that the study of this text in an academic environment be supplemented by visits to construction projects and/or audiovisual material. </p> <p> The author is convinced that all architecture and civil engineering students should be required to complete a basic course in construction as part of their professional studies. Because construction is the product of all design, no design can be a good one unless it can be readily and safely constructed. An appreciation of construction procedures will not only produce a better designer, but it will also be invaluable to the many graduates of such programs who end up directly involved in the construction industry. </p> <p> In response to industry developments and user comments, this sixth edition incorporates new and revised material to reflect current developments in the construction industry. New and expanded topics include construction use of the Internet (including the web addresses of major online resources), pull scrapers, rental equipment and the rental equipment industry, fire-retardant-treated wood and wood preservation, Superpave asphalt pavement, rapid repair of concrete pavements, hot- and cold-weather masonry construction, the cryogenic treatment of high-wear equipment components, and precautions in safely craning wood trusses, in addition to updated text, illustrations, and references. </p> <p> It would not be possible to produce a book of this type without the assistance of many individuals and organizations. The assistance of construction industry associations and construction equipment manufacturers in providing information and photographs and in permitting reproduction of certain elements of their material is gratefully acknowledged. I would also like to express my appreciation to my colleagues and to my former students for their helpful comments and suggestions. In addition, particular thanks are due to John Wiggins, New Jersey Institute of Technology; Donald Liou, University of North Carolina, Charlotte; and Michael J. Cook, University of Florida, for their assistance with the sixth edition text review. </p> <p> Comments from readers regarding errors and suggestions for improvement are solicited.

Nunnally</i> </p><p>"Construction Methods and Management by Nunnally is the only text I have found that comprehensively covers the methods and practices of the construction industry. The chapters are written in such a way that they are essentially independent and can be taught in any order the instructor wishes." &#x2014; John Wiggins, <i>New Jersey Institute of Technology</i></p></p><h2>Spiritual Care: Nursing Theory, Research, and Practice</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book provides practical guidance on many aspects of spiritual caregiving. It addresses many relevant topics including spiritual assessment, planning care, documentation, ethical concerns of sharing personal spiritual beliefs, and numerous approaches to nurturing the spirit. <b> </b> Presentation of religion as a positive factor influencing health and coping introduces readers to material in a manner that is sensitive to diverse spiritual beliefs. Two-tiered approach to assessment encourages readers to be empathetic listeners and identify spiritual need (first tier) and then, if necessary, follow up with more extensive assessment (second tier). Research Profiles boxed features provide readers with profiles of a research study conducted by a nurse on the topic of spirituality and health. One Nurse's Story boxed features illustrate a nurse's perspective of concepts and clinical examples of spiritual caregiving. <b> </b> For nursing professionals. </p></p><p><p> Innate and deeply personal, spirituality is an integral part of each of us. It affects every aspect of life-including one's health. For this reason, spirituality is becoming an increasingly important issue within the nursing community. Nursing the <i>whole</i> patient includes nurturing the spirit. <b> <i>Spiritual Care: Nursing Theory, Research, and Practice</i></b><i> </i> is the <i>only</i> text written to address the depth of this subject matter. Written from a universal standpoint, it details the "how-to's" of spiritual caregiving including spiritual assessment, planning care, documentation, ethical concerns, and numerous approaches to nurturing the spirit. Other features include: </p> <ul> <li> <b>A balanced presentation of religion</b> as both a positive and a negative factor that influences health and coping.</li> <li> <b>Chapter-ending</b> <i>Look Within to Learn</i> <b>features</b> encourage spiritual self-awareness and understanding of how spirituality influences clinical care.</li> <li> <i>Research Profiles</i> <b>boxed features</b> provide profiles of research studies that focus on spirituality and health.</li> <li> <i>One Nurse's Story</i> <b>boxed features</b> illustrate a nurse's perspective of concepts and clinical examples of spiritual caregiving.</li> <li> <b>Chapter-ending</b> <i>Key Points</i> summarize material to reinforce the information presented.</li> </ul><p> Spirituality in the context of health is reemerging in public and professional arenas as an essential and vital component of health care. As evidenced by mandates from national as well as local organizations, nurses are increasingly expected to incorporate the spiritual dimension within their care. Because spirituality represents an innate, integral dimension of all human beings, to nurse the whole client we must also nurse the spirit. </p> <p> Nursing literature has addressed the topic of spirituality primarily in theoretical and conceptual terms, and its inability to offer practical guidance to support the provision of spiritual care has created a gap in our nursing knowledge. This text aims to fill this gap by providing practical guidance on many aspects of spiritual caregiving. Practice, however, must be supported by theory and research. The practice suggestions offered in this book follow from theory and research in nursing as well as other related disciplines. </p> <p> Because of the deeply significant and often private nature of spirituality, communicating with clients about their spiritual needs requires sensitivity. Consideration of the role of the nurse with regards to spiritual matters raises important questions. Beyond offering the significant expertise of empathic listening and presencing, what role should the nurse play? </p> <p> This text asserts that every nurse should strive to attain competence in the provision of sensitive, effective, and individualized spiritual care. To be effective, this care should incorporate the two-tiered approach to assessment presented in Chapter 5. If a spiritual need is identified during an initial, brief assessment (first tier), more extensive assessment follows (second tier). At any point, the nurse may conclude that a client does not require spiritual care, or requires it from a chaplain or other spiritual care expert. When referral is warranted, the client will still benefit from the nurse who provides the most basic spiritual care "interventions" of presencing and empathic listening. </p> <p> For many clients, assessment will reveal some manifestation of spiritual need or the opportunity for enhancing spiritual well-being. These clients will benefit from nursing care that incorporates the spiritual care interventions presented in this book. This text presents varied approaches and a number of spiritual care interventions from which the nurse can select in order to address client needs. As with other areas of nursing practice, a nurse's ability to provide effective spiritual care will improve with practice. </p> <p> An expression of spirituality, religion also is often a bridge to experiencing spirituality. Many nurses profess a religious orientation, which can enhance awareness of and sensitivity to client spiritual needs. The nurse's religious background may in some cases also create bias that can interfere with effective care. This text encourages the nurse to recognize that personal beliefs affect care and to develop and sustain awareness of personal beliefs in order to enhance the effectiveness of spiritual care. This text also embraces the position that nurses will derive significant benefits from engaging in activities that promote their own spiritual health. </p> <p> Just as a scientific study is influenced by the context under which it is conducted, a book's approach will be influenced by the worldview of its author. The author, who has endeavored to present spirituality in a manner sensitive to diverse spiritual experiences, acknowledges a religio-cultural background that is Western and Judeo-Christian. Furthermore, the research and nursing literature available represents, for the most part, a similar framework. Sensitivity and appreciation for diversity can help to overcome limitations created by this or any other bias. </p> <p> One way to show religio-cultural sensitivity is to refer to centuries as either being Before the Common Era (B.c.E.) or in the Common Era (c.E.), a generic way to refer to what Christians would consider anno Domini (A.D., or a year in the Christian era). This book, therefore, uses B.c.E. and c.E. to designate dates. </p> <p><b>STRUCTURE OF THE TEXT</b></p> <p> This text is organized into three sections. Part I explores spirituality in nursing in order to establish a basis for Part II, which addresses nursing practice issues and strategies that support spiritual caregiving, and Part III, which presents specific interventions for promoting client spiritual health. </p> <p> Several features enhance learning about spiritual care. Boxes accompany the narrative to extend learning by synthesizing information and to illustrate concepts through examples such as case studies or nursing care plans. Research Profiles summarize studies and their relevance to practice. One Client's/Nurse's Story is a feature that illustrates the application of principles of spiritual care. Each chapter concludes with Key Points to support content review and Look Within to Learn questions to encourage the development of self-awareness. Highlighted references identify literature that is likely to be especially helpful to the reader who desires further knowledge. </p></p><h2>Gris Grimly&#39;s Frankenstein</h2><p><p>"Grimly enlivens the prose while retaining its power to both frighten and engage sympathy for the monster-creator Victor Frankenstein.
